Why India's poorest state continues to struggle with illegal alcohol sales,"Nine years after imposing a statewide alcohol ban to curb addiction, domestic violence, and financial ruin among its poorest families, Bihar - India's poorest state - still struggles to gauge the policy's effectiveness. The gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers. Armed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery. On reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor. Vapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm. The officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived. ""They often get tipped off before a raid,"" an officer who didn't wish to be named said. Despite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3de4dqvk8o,19/11/2025
Dadri lynching case: Mohammad Akhlaq's family says won't stop fight for justice,"The family of a Muslim man, who was lynched by a Hindu mob in India's Uttar Pradesh state in 2015, say they will continue fighting for justice after authorities recently moved to drop all charges against the accused. Mohammad Akhlaq, then 50, was beaten to death after rumours spread that he had stored and consumed beef, a claim his family continues to deny. Slaughter of cows is a sensitive issue in India as the animal is considered sacred by Hindus, who comprise 80% of the country's 1.4 billion people. Uttar Pradesh is among the 20 states with strict laws banning cow slaughter and the sale and consumption of beef. The attack, which took place in Dadri - 49km (31 miles) from the capital Delhi - was the first major and widely reported case of cow-related violence in India and sparked widespread protests. Akhlaq's family's lawyer told BBC Hindi that 18 people were charged for various offences, including murder and rioting. All of them are out on bail. Now the Bharatiya Janata Party...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3delkdjkqo,19/11/2025
Nitish Kumar takes oath as Bihar chief minister after NDA's landslide election win,"Days after recording a landslide victory in India's Bihar state, Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar has taken oath as chief minister. Kumar's party and its allies, which includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won 202 out of 243 seats in the recently-held polls. Kumar, 74, one of the state's most influential political figures, took office for a record 10th time. The polls were held after a controversial revision of lists that the opposition alleged would exclude genuine voters and give BJP an edge - a charge both the party and Election Commission denied. Kumar has been Bihar's chief minister for most part of the last two decades, leaving a nine-month window between 2014 and 2015. He was sworn in before a large crowd in Patna on Thursday, a day after his party's legislators chose him as their leader and the wider alliance endorsed the decision.

Two hundred federalized troops had arrived in the city over a month ago with a mission from the Trump administration to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other US Government personnel ‚Äì but instead stayed waiting at training bases for weeks.

Last nuclear treaty between US and Russia nears expiration as Trump and Putin trade testing threats | CNN Politics,"US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have spent weeks trading threats to restart nuclear tests, an escalation kicked off by Putin‚Äôs boasts about tests of the Poseidon nuclear powered missile in late October.

Her admission sent shockwaves through the courtroom on Wednesday, where attorneys were gathered to argue a separate legal issue of whether Comey was charged only because of President Donald Trump‚Äôs animus toward him.
