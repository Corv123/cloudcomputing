The gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers. Armed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery. On reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor. Vapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm. The officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived. ""They often get tipped off before a raid,"" an officer who didn't wish to be named said. Despite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3de4dqvk8o,19/11/2025
Dadri lynching case: Mohammad Akhlaq's family says won't stop fight for justice,"The family of a Muslim man, who was lynched by a Hindu mob in India's Uttar Pradesh state in 2015, say they will continue fighting for justice after authorities recently moved to drop all charges against the accused. Mohammad Akhlaq, then 50, was beaten to death after rumours spread that he had stored and consumed beef, a claim his family continues to deny. Slaughter of cows is a sensitive issue in India as the animal is considered sacred by Hindus, who comprise 80% of the country's 1.4 billion people. Uttar Pradesh is among the 20 states with strict laws banning cow slaughter and the sale and consumption of beef. The attack, which took place in Dadri - 49km (31 miles) from the capital Delhi - was the first major and widely reported case of cow-related violence in India and sparked widespread protests. Akhlaq's family's lawyer told BBC Hindi that 18 people were charged for various offences, including murder and rioting. All of them are out on bail. Now the Bharatiya Janata Party...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3delkdjkqo,19/11/2025
Nitish Kumar takes oath as Bihar chief minister after NDA's landslide election win,"Days after recording a landslide victory in India's Bihar state, Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar has taken oath as chief minister. Kumar's party and its allies, which includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won 202 out of 243 seats in the recently-held polls. Kumar, 74, one of the state's most influential political figures, took office for a record 10th time. The polls were held after a controversial revision of lists that the opposition alleged would exclude genuine voters and give BJP an edge - a charge both the party and Election Commission denied. Kumar has been Bihar's chief minister for most part of the last two decades, leaving a nine-month window between 2014 and 2015. He was sworn in before a large crowd in Patna on Thursday, a day after his party's legislators chose him as their leader and the wider alliance endorsed the decision.

Two hundred federalized troops had arrived in the city over a month ago with a mission from the Trump administration to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other US Government personnel ‚Äì but instead stayed waiting at training bases for weeks.

Last nuclear treaty between US and Russia nears expiration as Trump and Putin trade testing threats | CNN Politics,"US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have spent weeks trading threats to restart nuclear tests, an escalation kicked off by Putin‚Äôs boasts about tests of the Poseidon nuclear powered missile in late October.

Her admission sent shockwaves through the courtroom on Wednesday, where attorneys were gathered to argue a separate legal issue of whether Comey was charged only because of President Donald Trump‚Äôs animus toward him.

When the moment came for Zammi to be taken from her arms, Keira says she sobbed uncontrollably, whispering ""sorry"" to her baby. ""It felt like a part of my soul died."" Now Keira is one of many Greenlandic families living on the Danish mainland who are fighting to get their children returned to them after they were removed by social services. In such cases, babies and children were taken away after parental competency tests - known in Denmark as FKUs - were used to help assess whether they were fit to be parents. In May this year the Danish government banned the use of these tests on Greenlandic families after decades of criticism, although they continue to be used on other families in Denmark. The assessments, which usually take months to...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wlw2qj113o,22/11/2025
Indian fighter jet pilot killed in crash at Dubai airshow,"A pilot has died after an Indian fighter jet crashed while performing a display at an airshow in Dubai, officials have said.

Long throw-ins: Which Premier League teams are kings of the long throw? - BBC Sport,"Brentford's Michael Kayode has taken 54 long throws in 11 games this season Once upon a time the long throw was almost exclusively the preserve of Tony Pulis and his Stoke City team, but now it is being used by pretty much every Premier League team - and it is working. Last season 20 goals were scored through throw-in routines. We are only 11 rounds into the 2025-26 season and already we have had 12 goals come about this way. It is also shown in the increase in the average length of a throw. Two seasons ago it was 16.5m, last season it was 16.7, and there has been a leap in this campaign to 18.6. A long throw is defined by data analysts Opta as exceeding 20m, so the average length of a throw is creeping up to that. But who are the greatest exponents of the long throw? Are some grounds more suitable than others? And does Sunderland's cunning tactic of moving the advertising boards make a difference? It probably helps that Brentford manager Keith Andrews used to be the set-piece coach,...",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj414dn2reeo,22/11/2025
India's largest conglomerate stops Russian oil imports amid global pressure,"India's largest conglomerate Reliance Industries, owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has stopped importing Russian crude oil for its export-only refining unit at Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat. The move aims to comply with an EU ban on fuel imports made from Russian oil through third countries, which takes effect next year. It also aligns with US sanctions on major Russian oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil, set to kick in on Friday. ""This transition has been completed ahead of schedule to ensure full compliance with product-import restrictions coming into force on 21 January 2026,"" Reliance said in a statement. The White House has welcomed the move by Reliance. ""We welcome this shift and look forward to advancing meaningful progress on US-India trade talks,"" the White House press office said, in a statement to the Washington Post. Delhi's purchase of Russian oil has been a major sticking point between India and the US. Trump slapped India with 50% tariffs in August,...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d911e7nxeo,21/11/2025
Palestinians forced from West Bank refugee camps left in limbo as Israeli demolitions go on,"""They punished ordinary people. This is collective punishment."" It's been more than nine months since 54-year-old Nehaya al-Jundi last saw her home in the Palestinian refugee camp of Nur Shams, in the occupied West Bank, after being forced to evacuate by the Israeli military. ""They punished the infrastructure, the institutions and people of the camp."" In a café in nearby Tulkarm, Nehaya speaks to the BBC about her family's panicked flight, as Israeli troops stormed into the camp in early February. For two days Nehaya watched and listened in terror as military bulldozers razed the area around her house.

Eventually, on 9 February, Nehaya escaped with her 75-year-old husband, Zaydan, and their teenage daughter Salma. ""When we got out, I was shocked by the damage in the area,"" she says.

Marjorie Taylor Greene to quit Congress after Trump feud,"Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will resign from office, an unexpected turn for the high-profile Republican. One of Donald Trump's Maga superstars and staunchest defenders, the Georgia congresswoman's relentless calls for releasing files related to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and recent criticism of some of his policies led to a bitter public feud. After the US president labelled her a ""traitor"", she said in a video announcing her departure: ""I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better."" Trump, who had threatened to support a Republican challenger to unseat Greene, called her resignation ""great news for the country"" in an interview with ABC News. She said in her video statement, posted on social media, that she would leave the US Congress on 5 January 2026.

Ashes 2025-26: How 30 minutes cost England in first Test in Perth - BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Australia 'fighting back' as Pope becomes second wicket to fall after lunch It took just 30 minutes. A position of strength in the first Ashes Test wasted by a horror collapse, resulting in an Australian comeback and an awful two-day defeat. If we measure the metric in balls, it was just 26. Whichever way you cut it though, it could come to define this Ashes series. When England walked out after lunch on day two of the first Test, they were 59-1 and 99 runs in front. From there, they slumped to 164 all out. At one stage they lost three wickets in six deliveries without scoring a run. The game was there for Ben Stokes' side. A calm afternoon session, just like the one before lunch, would have moved them into a position where a 1-0 series lead looked the only outcome. Instead they depart Perth beaten in an all-too familiar way.

Family of missing Colombian seek answers after US strike on alleged drug boat,"Lizbeth Perez looks fearful as she gazes out onto the postcard-perfect fishing bay of Taganga, on Colombia's Caribbean coast, recalling the moment she last spoke to her uncle in September. ""He was a kind man, a good person, a friend. A good father, uncle, son. He was a cheerful person. He loved his work and his fishing."" Alejandro Carranza said goodbye to his family early in the morning on 14 September, before going out on his boat as usual, his cousin Audenis Manjarres told state media. He left from La Guajira, a region in neighbouring Venezuela, he said. The next day, US President Donald Trump announced that a US strike in international waters had targeted a vessel which had departed Venezuela, and that three people he described as ""extraordinarily violent drug-trafficking cartels and narco-terrorists"" were killed. Ms Perez has not seen her uncle since.

COP30: India's delayed action plan raises eyebrows at UN climate summit,"At this year's UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil's Belem city, all eyes are on India - the world's third largest carbon emitter. India has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are required to do every five years, even as international assessments have deemed India's climate action as being ""worryingly inadequate"". Delhi has argued otherwise. Known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC) is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global warming. So far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones. The Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C to avert drastic climate change.

Mexico: Seven bodyguards arrested over mayor's murder,"Seven bodyguards have been arrested over their alleged involvement in the murder of a popular Mexican mayor, authorities have said. Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan and an outspoken critic of cartel violence, was shot dead on 1 November at a public event marking the Day of the Dead. The office of the attorney general of Michoacán state said in a brief statement that the public servants had been detained ""for their probable participation in the crime of aggravated homicide, in commission by omission"" in relation to Manzo's killing. It follows the arrest on Wednesday of a man police described as the mastermind behind the murder, who officials said had links to a powerful cartel. The attorney general's office in Michoacán, to the west of the capital, Mexico City, said the seven guards had been arrested by both state and federal officials, including the National Guard.

Outcry at France army chief's warning that country must prepare to 'lose children' in war,"A stark warning from France's new army chief about the country ""losing its children"" in a potential war with Russia has sharply divided political opinion. Gen Fabien Mandon, who took over as army chief-of-staff in September, told a congress of mayors on Tuesday that France's biggest weakness in today's dangerous times was the lack of a will to fight. ""We have the know-how, and we have the economic and demographic strength to dissuade the regime in Moscow,"" he said. ""What we are lacking - and this is where you [the mayors] have a role to play - is the spirit. The spirit which accepts that we will have to suffer if we are to protect what we are. ""If our country wavers because it is not ready to lose its children … or to suffer economically because the priority has to be military production, then we are indeed at risk.

India's blind women cricketers chase history at first T20 World Cup,"The ongoing inaugural Blind Women's T20 Cricket World Cup has put the spotlight on visually impaired Indian women who have overcome immense challenges to reach this stage.

The T20 tournament - a six-team event featuring India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and the USA - began on 11 November in Delhi. After a few matches in Bengaluru, the venue for the knockouts has now moved to Sri Lanka's capital Colombo. The 16-member Indian squad represents nine states - Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Assam, and Bihar.

How a flashy lawyer and an alleged Canadian drug lord may have taken down an FBI witness,"Months before an FBI witness was gunned down in broad daylight, a Toronto-area lawyer allegedly advised his client: ""if you kill this witness, the case will be dismissed"". Speaking to media on Wednesday, US attorney Bill Essayli alleged that this advice, between lawyer Deepak Paradkar and Ryan Wedding, a former Olympic snowboarder who ended up on the FBI's most wanted list for allegedly running a sprawling drug trafficking empire, helped trigger a series of events that led to a key federal witness being gunned down at a restaurant in Medellín, Colombia. In exchange for his services, Mr Paradkar, who for a time posted on social media as @cocaine_lawyer, was allegedly paid in luxury watches and extra lawyer fees. Those allegations and more were contained in a 54-page FBI indictment that was unsealed on Wednesday by the US Justice Department. It named 19 defendants, including Mr Wedding and Mr Paradkar, as being connected to the murder of the federal witness, named in local media as...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8747v1w7pyo,21/11/2025
Vietnam: At least 41 dead as relentless rains flood central region,"Relentless rains and floods have killed at least 41 people in central Vietnam since the weekend, while a search continues for nine still missing, state media reports. The deluge has submerged more than 52,000 homes and left half a million households and businesses without power, according to reports. Tens of thousands of residents have been evacuated from the flood-affected regions. Rainfall has exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas over the past three days, even rising beyond the 1993 flood peak of 5.2m in some parts. Extreme weather has battered Vietnam in recent months. Two typhoons, Kalmaegi and Bualoi, left a trail of death and destruction within weeks of each other. Natural disasters in Vietnam have wreaked damage amounting to $2bn (£1.5bn) between January and October this year, according to government estimates.

"Bengaluru: Men posing as Reserve Bank of India officials pull off $800,000 heist","Armed men posing as officials from India's central bank have robbed a vehicle transporting 70m rupees ($800,000; £600,000) in the southern state of Karnataka, police say. A massive operation has been launched to find the men who robbed the van in the heart of Bengaluru city in daylight. The robbery occurred on Wednesday afternoon. Six men in an SUV stopped a cash transport van on a busy road as it was moving money between bank branches, Bengaluru police commissioner Seemant Kumar Singh told the BBC. The van was carrying a driver, a cash custodian and two armed security guards. Mr Singh says the robbers told the people in the van that they were officials from the Reserve Bank of India and needed to verify if they had the correct documents to transport such a huge amount of money. The gang told the cash custodian and guards to leave their weapons in the van and get into the SUV, while the driver was instructed to continue driving with the cash, police said.

In the first two-day Ashes Test since 1921, Head dismantled the England attack with the second-fastest Ashes hundred of all time, made off only 69 balls. Head's 123 led Australia to their target of 205 in only 28.2 overs - just a session of batting. An eight-wicket victory puts the home side 1-0 up in the five-match series.

UK expected to approve plans for Chinese mega embassy,"The UK government is expected to approve China's plans for a new mega embassy in central London. A final decision has not yet been formally taken, but the advice ministers are understood to have received from the intelligence agencies clears the path for the controversial project to be given the go ahead. The expected green light – first reported by the Times newspaper – will become the latest case study in the growing public argument about how wise a close relationship with Beijing is. The approval or rejection of the planning application lies with the Housing Secretary Steve Reed – in what is known as a quasi-judicial decision. But given the sensitivities of this judgement call, many others have been consulted – including MI5 and MI6. The decision has repeatedly been delayed and last month the government pushed back a deadline to rule on the application to 10 December.

Takeaways from Trump and Mamdani's surprisingly cordial meeting,"US President Donald Trump met New York City's newly elected mayor Zohran Mamdani at the White House in what was billed as the political showdown of the year - but instead became a praise fest. In his election victory speech, the self-described Democratic socialist mayor called Trump a ""despot"". And before Friday's meeting, the president's spokeswoman had billed Mamdani's visit as a ""communist coming to the White House"". But standing side-by-side in the Oval Office, the two men struck a surprisingly conciliatory tone. Over and over, both men emphasised their shared interest in addressing New York City's affordability crisis. They smiled often, and Trump even appeared amused as reporters asked him about the political attacks Mamdani had fired his way. The tone of the meeting appeared to strike political observers off-guard, but offered a signal that both men understand that tackling the affordability crisis is critical to their political success. Whether the truce will last once Mamdani...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqd42gl0qo,22/11/2025
G20: Will Trump’s no-show eclipse South Africa’s moment?,"When it assumed the presidency of the G20 last year, South Africa hoped that as the first African country to host the gathering of world leaders, it could champion issues that mattered the most to developing nations. For instance, it wanted the 20 heads of state from the world's biggest economies to consider arguments that borrowing should be cheaper for developing countries, which pay two to four times more in interest on debts than more advanced economies. Other themes of this weekend's summit include securing climate change financing, increasing the participation of African countries in multilateral forums and ensuring that they get the best value out of their critical minerals. But so far, discourse surrounding the meeting has been dominated by Donald Trump's very public decision not to attend. The US president said he would not go due to the widely discredited claim that South Africa's white minority is the victim of large-scale killings and land grabs.

Australia's social media ban for kids under 16 - how will it work?,"From 10 December, social media companies will have to take ""reasonable steps"" to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed. The government says the ban - a world-first policy popular with many parents - is aimed at reducing the ""pressures and risks"" children can be exposed to on social media, which come from ""design features that encourage them to spend more time on screens, while also serving up content that can harm their health and wellbeing"". A study commissioned by the government earlier this year said 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour. This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide. One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo,21/11/2025
Streaming platform Twitch added to Australia's teen social media ban,"Twitch, a streaming platform popular with gamers, has been added to Australia's teen social media ban that starts next month. It joins other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat that must ensure under-16s cannot open accounts and that existing ones are closed from 10 December. Australia's internet regulator overseeing the ban said Twitch - owned by Amazon -had been included as its main purpose was ""online social interaction"" where users were encouraged to chat to each other about posted content. A Twitch spokesperson said Australians under 16 will not be able to open a Twitch account from 10 December and that from 9 January existing under-16s accounts will be deactivated. On her reasons why Twitch had been included, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it was ""a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted"".

Ukraine allies to hold talks on White House peace plan at G20,"Ukraine's allies will seek to ""strengthen"" a US plan to end the war with Russia when they meet at the G20 summit in South Africa, UK PM Sir Keir Starmer has said. The summit begins a day after President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukraine faced ""one of the most difficult moments in our history"" over pressure to accept the plan - leaked details of which have been seen as favourable to Moscow. Zelensky held phone talks with Sir Keir and the leaders of France and Germany on Friday. Afterwards, the PM said Ukraine's ""friends and partners"" remained committed to securing a ""lasting peace once and for all"". Neither US President Donald Trump nor Russian President Vladimir Putin are attending the G20.

Steve Rosenberg: Putin uncompromising as leaked plan reaches Moscow,"It was quite a contrast. On Thursday, a US Pentagon delegation was in Kyiv. They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan to end the war in Ukraine. The same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on. ""We have our tasks, our goals,"" the Kremlin leader declared. ""The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation."" The Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post ""a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms"". Which brings us back to the peace plan. On Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine. Addressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a ""modernised"" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.

Move over fillers - people are getting facial injections derived from fish sperm,"In my many years as a journalist, I never thought I would be asking someone how it feels to have trout sperm injected into their face. Abby Warnes is lying on a large, black padded chair at a small aesthetics clinic in south Manchester. She winces as a small cannula is delicately inserted into her cheek. ""Ouch. Ouch,"" she exclaims. I should make it clear that 29-year-old Abby is not actually receiving a pure dose of trout sperm. The lower part of her face is being injected with tiny fragments of DNA, known as polynucleotides, which have been extracted from either trout or salmon sperm. Why? Well, interestingly, our DNA is pretty similar to that of a fish. So the hope is Abby's body will not only welcome these tiny strands of fish DNA, her skin cells will be spurred into action, producing more collagen and elastin, two proteins which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of our skin. For Abby, the aim is to freshen her skin, keep it healthy, and hopefully, treat the acne...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e0j1lv123o,22/11/2025
"Miss Universe: Mexico's Fatima Bosch, who walked out on organisers, wins pageant","Miss Mexico Fatima Bosch has been crowned Miss Universe at a ceremony in Bangkok, marking the end of an exceptionally scandal-filled pageant season. The 25-year-old contestant had walked out of an event earlier in November after a Thai official publicly berated her in front of dozens of contestants and threatened to disqualify those who supported her. That dramatic turn was followed a week later by the resignation of two judges, one of whom accused organisers of rigging the competition. These come as one of the world's longest-running beauty pageants faces questions of its relevancy and a declining audience. The contest's latest result has added to the controversy, with news of Miss Mexico's win instantly dividing opinion online. Many Mexicans celebrated her victory, as did others who had applauded her walkout. But some have also wondered if organisers gave her the crown to make up for the earlier scandal.

Ashes first Test: Australia and England player ratings - BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Head century hands Australia emphatic first Test win over England Backed for Australian conditions but returned only the fourth Ashes pair by an England opener in just 11 balls faced. Got starts in both innings. His dismissal on Saturday was when it began to unravel for England. Looks better for technical tweaks. The first Test of a series is usually his best, then it goes downhill. England need him to kick on. Miles away from that first hundred in Australia. England need the nous of their best player if they are to come back from this. His half-century in the first innings was skittish, but valuable. Awful shot in the second innings. Came back from injury with a five-wicket haul, though looked short of rhythm with the bat. Lost control in the field in the face of Head's assault. Could have the game for Australia, but needs to smarten up. Can expect plenty of short bowling from now on.

Las Vegas Grand Prix: Lando Norris eyes prize but weighs question of risk v reward - BBC Sport,"Lando Norris (right) will start the Las Vegas Grand Prix from pole position with Max Verstappen, second on the grid, alongside him The conflict in Lando Norris' mind as he closes on his first world title was clear after he took pole position for the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Norris expertly navigated the treacherous wet conditions on a track almost devoid of grip to take pole position from Red Bull's Max Verstappen by a margin of 0.323 seconds - a gap that could have been significantly larger had the Briton not had a major wobble through the chicane at the end of the Strip on his fastest lap. Norris goes into the race 24 points ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, who starts fifth, and 49 clear of Verstappen. All year, as the championship has unfolded, he has insisted he is taking the season one race at a time, and not changing his approach.

Five killed and more than 450 injured in Bangladesh earthquake,"At least five people have been killed, including one child, and more than 450 injured after a 5.5 magnitude earthquake hit Bangladesh.

"Wieambilla ambush: Australian police murder not an act of religious terrorism, coroner finds","The murder of two police officers at a rural Australian property in 2022 was not a religious terror attack, Queensland's state coroner has found – despite authorities previously declaring it the first such case in the nation's history. Constables Matthew Arnold and Rachel McCrow were on a routine visit to the property at Wieambilla in December 2022 when Nathaniel, Gareth and Stacey Train ambushed and killed them. The attack triggered an hours-long siege which ended with police fatally shooting the trio. Now, in findings released on Friday, authorities have declared that the ambush was not an act of terrorism, while acknowledging that the Trains were religious fanatics and conspiracy theorists. State Coroner Terry Ryan said the trio acted ""defensively within their delusional framework to defend themselves and their property from what they regarded was an evil advance on them"". ""In the months before 12 December 2022, they had been seeking to dissuade police engagement with them on their...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm213ym729eo,21/11/2025
Nigeria sees one of worst mass abductions as 315 taken from school,"More than 300 children and staff are now thought to have been kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in central Nigeria, making it one of the worst mass abductions the country has seen. The Christian Association of Nigeria said 303 students and 12 teachers were taken from on St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state - substantially more than previously estimated. It said the figures have been revised upwards ""after a verification exercise"". The kidnapping comes amid a surge of attacks by armed groups. The revised number of people taken surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014. Local police said armed men stormed the school at around 02:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Friday morning, abducting students who were staying there. Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: ""Everybody is weak... it took everybody by surprise.""

The Christian converts the US is deporting back to Iran,"One Monday in mid-October, after a year in US immigration detention, officers arrived unannounced at Majid's cell in Texas. They told him simply to ""pack up"" - that he was being moved - even though an immigration judge had already granted him protection from removal five months ago. Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana. Majid - not his real name - had fled Iran for the US in October 2024, after repeated detentions and alleged torture, first because of his involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, and later because of his conversion to Christianity. When US officials forced him to board a plane carrying more than 150 deportees heading to Managua, Nicaragua, he remembers being the only non–Latin American on the plane. Hours later, the flight landed and officials handcuffed him, denied his request for asylum and directed him onto an itinerary routing him through Venezuela and Turkey toward Iran - a journey he...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdege0k962do,22/11/2025
"In Mozambique, an ISIS insurgency is newly energized as US cuts impact aid programs | CNN","Musty salt air crept at dusk over the nets and moored boats on northern Mozambique‚Äôs coast as seven armed and uniformed men marched into the fishing community last month, demanding the keys to the mosque. Once inside, they commanded ‚Äì over the microphone used for the call to prayer ‚Äì that locals on the edge of the port town of Mocimboa da Praia come to listen. It was only when they unfurled an ISIS banner, the mosque‚Äôs imam Sumail Issa told CNN, that it became clear who they were. Also palpable was the new-found confidence of the jihadists, emerging in recent months after the chaotic collapse of US aid funding to one of Africa‚Äôs poorest countries. ‚ÄúWhen they called everyone over, as soon as they saw that flag, a colleague and I left, saying we needed the toilet,‚Äù Issa said, adding they went to notify the military.

Sheikh Hasina: Bangladesh plans to execute its former leader. There‚Äôs one big thing in the way: India | CNN,"She was once cast as a secular heroine, the daughter of a revolutionary leader, whose brutal assassination in the 1970s defined her political ascent. But Sheikh Hasina‚Äôs rise to the top of Bangladesh‚Äôs politics preceded a stunning fall from power to self-exile in India. A death sentence delivered in absentia could now see her executed ‚Äì if New Delhi decides to send her back. The ousted leader was found guilty of crimes against humanity for the violent suppression of student protests that toppled her regime in 2024. She fled to India last August after 15 years of increasingly authoritarian rule, seeking refuge in the capital of one of her closest allies. Now she‚Äôs become a pawn in a tense standoff between the two countries as Dhaka demands her extradition to face justice for crimes that she insists she did not commit. ‚ÄúShe had to flee the country to flee the rage of the people,‚Äù said Bangladeshi political scientist Mubashar Hasan. ‚ÄúHiding in India and handed down a death...",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/asia/bangladesh-india-sheikh-hasina-death-sentence-intl-hnk-dst,22/11/2025
Tracking state congressional redistricting efforts | CNN Politics,"President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the party‚Äôs narrow majority in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own, setting off a series of fights across the country ‚Äî including in the courts ‚Äî which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress. Most recently, a federal court blocked Texas from using its new map in next year‚Äôs midterms, ruling that it is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander and ordering Texas to use its previous map in the election. The ruling is likely to be appealed, but if it stands, Republicans could end up on the losing end of the mid-decade redistricting fight they started. Not all states are agreeing to redraw their maps.

The biggest reason America is turning on Target and switching to Walmart | CNN Business,"Walmart has blown past Target in their long-running rivalry. The biggest reason: As life becomes harder for everyday Americans to afford, shoppers have grown pickier about how they spend their money and hunted for deals. Many of these consumers feel Walmart can stretch their dollars further on groceries, household essentials, clothing and electronics. Target, meanwhile, traditionally catering to a slightly higher-income customer, has suffered a major dent to its ‚ÄúTar-zhay‚Äù appeal. ‚ÄúEveryone wants value,‚Äù Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who recently announced he was retiring after 11 years, said on a quarterly earnings call Thursday. Walmart‚Äôs US sales increased 4.5% last quarter, while Target‚Äôs dropped 2.7%, continuing a years-long divergence in sales and stock price between the companies.

The earlier bounce back came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could get a December rate cut, after all. Friday‚Äôs gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets. Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December?

The 28-point plan put forward by Trump puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war, all long-standing Kremlin demands. It was characterized by Zelensky during a video address to the nation on Friday as presenting Ukraine with a choice between losing its dignity or a key ally.

JD Vance expressed hope his Hindu wife will become a Christian. That‚Äôs ruffled feathers in India | CNN,"When JD Vance told a stadium of thousands he hoped his wife would one day be moved ‚Äúby the Christian gospel‚Äù the same way he was, he inadvertently stepped into a contentious dialogue in India and among the diaspora about religious freedom and, for some, evoked memories of the country‚Äôs complicated past with Christian proselytizing. Speaking at an event last month with Turning Point USA at the University of Mississippi, Vance was asked by an audience member about Christianity and American patriotism. ‚ÄúWhy are we making Christianity one of the major things that you have to have in common to be one of you guys?

Russia‚Äôs drone revolution heaps pressure on Ukrainian defenses | CNN,"A top-secret Russian unit based in Moscow has changed the landscape of drone warfare, turning what was an advantage for the Ukrainians into a vulnerability. The unit is known as Rubicon and has expanded rapidly under Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov since his appointment in June last year. Belousov visited its headquarters in October 2024 and was shown a range of drones being developed, according to video published by official Russian media. The advent of Rubicon ‚Äì full name the Rubicon Center for Advanced Unmanned Technologies ‚Äì is a prime example of how the Russian military has learnt to shrug off its rigid way of warfare during the Ukraine conflict and adapt to a rapidly evolving battlefield.

Trump became the first sitting president to attend a regular-season NFL game since Jimmy Carter in 1978 when he attended a game between the Washington Commanders and Detroit Lions earlier this month. Two days later, Trump appeared on ‚ÄúThe Pat McAfee Show‚Äù and torched the league‚Äôs dynamic kickoff rule, which owners voted to make permanent this year.

The success of the forced Epstein files vote is emboldening some Republicans to go it alone | CNN Politics,"House Speaker Mike Johnson may want to put the Jeffrey Epstein saga behind him, but some Republicans saw rank-and-file members‚Äô success in forcing Tuesday‚Äôs vote as an opportunity to push their own legislative priorities to the floor ‚Äî even if it doesn‚Äôt have leadership‚Äôs blessing.

A witch in trousers? Weird | CNN,"In popular culture, the archetypal look of a witch is a female figure generally depicted wearing a black dress, robe, or cloak. Typically, she also sports a pointed hat and carries a broomstick that doubles as her mode of transport.

As ‚ÄúWicked: For Good,‚Äù the sequel to the modern film adaptation directed by Jon M.

Trump is giving Russia almost everything it wants with his Ukraine peace plan | CNN,"Trying the same thing over and over again, without success, is either the definition of insanity or Russian negotiation tactics, depending on your point of view. The widely leaked draft of President Donald Trump‚Äôs 28-point plan is a terrifying leap backwards for Kyiv. It was co-conceived by Russians who wanted to pretend they were engaging in peace, and circulated by Ukrainians and Europeans who felt it was so ridiculous it would surely die on first contact with oxygen. Much of the text resembles the maximalist positions Russia held during talks in Istanbul in 2022 when its forces held more of Ukraine, and the slow, grinding military embarrassment of the past three years was still ahead of them. Before we dissect the text - and its profound, dizzying advantages for the Kremlin - the timing of this renewed, mostly Moscow-initiated plan, is key.

Golden State Killer case update: A prosecutor reveals new details about the capture of one of America‚Äôs most notorious serial killers | CNN,"Joseph DeAngelo moved through California neighborhoods like a shadow. He stalked his victims for days, learning their routines before slipping into their homes in a mask to torture, rape and kill. At first, he preyed on women who lived alone but later expanded his attacks to include couples. He pocketed wedding rings, photos and other grim tokens from crime scenes. What started as burglaries and break-ins escalated into brutal attacks and murders that left entire neighborhoods too terrified to sleep. Each wave of terror in a different part of California came with a new nickname: The Visalia Ransacker. The Original Night Stalker. The East Area Rapist. And finally, the Golden State Killer. DeAngelo killed at least 13 people and raped dozens more in the 1970s and 1980s.

Peru‚Äôs ancient ‚Äòband of holes‚Äô mystery may be solved | CNN,"A series of about 5,200 holes stretching nearly a mile (1.5 kilometers) across the Pisco Valley in the southern Peruvian Andes has baffled researchers for nearly a century.

"US cancer registries, constrained by Trump policies, to recognize only ‚Äòmale‚Äô or ‚Äòfemale‚Äô patients | CNN","The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation‚Äôs most marginalized populations. Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings ‚Äî factors that could put them at higher risk of disease. The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only ‚Äúmale‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale‚Äù sexes, according to cancer researchers.

What if the United States had high-speed rail? - CNN,"By Eleanor Stubbs, Alex Leeds Matthews, Curt Merrill, Agne Jurkenaite and Alexandra Skores, CNN Published November 22, 2025 Americans planning holiday travel may be facing some of the worst flight delays in years. Although the government shutdown has ended, it could take months for air travel to fully recover. High-speed trains would offer Americans an attractive alternative — if they existed. Nearly 200 years ago, the United States opened its first modern railway and by 1850, it was home to more than 9,000 miles of railroad — as much as the rest of the world combined. Today, US train travel is unrecognizable from its heyday, yet there’s a proven alternative to gridlocked highways and overcrowded airports: high-speed trains. CNN has reimagined three of the busiest flight and road trip routes across the US mainland as high-speed rail lines – offering a glimpse into a faster, more connected future.",https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2025/11/travel/us-high-speed-rail-reimagined-vis/,22/11/2025

How the US-Israeli ‘peace plan’ will partition Gaza | Israel-Palestine conflict | Al Jazeera,"It is tapping into a well-known colonial strategy of isolating and fragmenting an occupied population. Since the ceasefire was announced on October 10, the division of Gaza into a so-called “green zone” under Israeli army control and a so-called “red zone”, where Palestinians have been displaced and contained, has solidified. Separating the two is the invisible “yellow line”. The administration of United States President Donald Trump has signalled that reconstruction will be limited to the “green zone” where Israel and its allies have been working on plans for so-called “alternative safe communities”. Although there are reports last week that these plans were dropped, colleagues in the humanitarian field have informed me that the first such community is still slated to be built in Rafah, southern Gaza and a further 10 are planned along the yellow line and into the north. If plans for these “safe communities” proceed, they would cement a deadly fragmentation of Gaza.

Africa does not need to borrow democracy; it needs to reclaim it | Opinions | Al Jazeera,"From the shir to the kgotla, Africa’s history demonstrates that democratic practice is indigenous, and reclaiming it is the key to a stronger future. Former Ambassador of Somalia to China and Sweden. For far too long, African youth have been told that democracy is something imported, something borrowed, something foreign to their identity. But history gives us a very different truth. Democracy is not an idea that arrived from the West. It is a human idea. And Africa practised it long before modern states existed. Africa’s democratic inheritance is older than the colonial borders that sliced the continent into fragments. In the Somali shir, every man could stand, argue, and vote in open councils that decided collective affairs. The Oromo Gadaa system developed rotating leadership and fixed term limits centuries before they became fashionable anywhere else. Igbo communities governed through village assemblies that rejected kings and insisted on consensus.

Opinion | Epstein and the #MeToo of It All - The New York Times,"“You need this renewal. You need new figures who are untouched, who were never part of these awful power games,” the columnist Lydia Polgreen argues. By Lydia Polgreen and Molly Jong-Fast Produced by Derek Arthur Much of the national discussion around the Epstein case has focused on the political drama. But as the Opinion columnist Lydia Polgreen and the contributing Opinion writer Molly Jong-Fast remind listeners, this is a case about the “conspiracy of silence” that perpetuates sexual violence against women. In this episode, the two writers explore the intertwining paths of the Epstein saga and the #MeToo movement, the challenges of accountability and whether this moment could mark a change for American culture and politics.

U.S. Defends Decision to Seek Death Penalty for Luigi Mangione - The New York Times,"Prosecutors argue that Mr. Mangione can receive a fair trial, despite his lawyers’ concerns about “damaging” statements from the attorney general about the murder case. By Benjamin Weiser and Hurubie Meko Federal prosecutors, in a new court filing on Friday night, defended the government’s decision to seek the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, the 27-year-old man accused of assassinating UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive nearly one year ago outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel. The government’s arguments came in response to a request from Mr. Mangione’s lawyers that the judge overseeing the federal case stop the government from pursuing the death penalty. The lawyers cited, among other factors, “blatant, intentional and damaging” statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other officials that they say will hurt Mr. Mangione’s ability to receive a fair trial. But the office of Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in the filing that “publicity —...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/nyregion/luigi-mangione-death-penalty.html,22/11/2025
"Supreme Court, For Now, Keeps in Place Texas Republican-Friendly Congressional Map - The New York Times","State officials have asked the justices to allow it to use a newly redrawn map for the 2026 midterms, part of a nationwide redistricting push by President Trump. Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court on Friday evening temporarily allowed Texas to use its newly redrawn, Republican-friendly congressional voting map for the 2026 midterm elections. The decision blocked, for now, a lower-court ruling that had said Texas could not use the map. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who is assigned to handle emergency applications from that region of the country, issued the administrative stay, a temporary ruling meant to give the full court time to consider the issue. The Texas attorney general earlier in the evening had filed an emergency application with the justices, asking them to allow the state to use the new map. Justice Alito requested that the civil rights groups that had challenged the map respond to the attorney general’s request by Monday at 5 p.m., signaling the court would likely...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/supreme-court-texas-congressional-map.html,21/11/2025

Trump Offers a Ukraine Peace Plan the Kremlin Can Love - The New York Times,"While President Trump at times suggested he was willing to bolster support for Ukraine, he has repeatedly accommodated Russia’s demands. David E. Sanger has covered five American presidents in more than four decades at The New York Times. He writes frequently on the new shape of superpower conflict, the subject of his most recent book. After veering wildly this year over how to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, President Trump appeared in recent weeks to have settled into a strategy of suggesting he was willing to put long-term pressure on Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. He imposed new sanctions on oil sales, though not as strong as many in Congress would have liked. He agreed to provide arms to Ukraine’s forces as long as they were purchased by the Europeans, bringing billions of dollars to American defense contractors. At one point, he even floated the notion that he would provide Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, only to back away from offering the long-range weapons after a...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-plan-kremlin.html,22/11/2025
The Trump-Mamdani Buddy Movie? It’s Getting Mixed Reviews. - The New York Times,"Zohran Mamdani and President Trump seemed to cast aside their months of traded insults, a development that seemed good for New York City but odd to some followers. By Dana Rubinstein and Benjamin Oreskes There were smiles and more than a few laughs. Compliments, ranging from genuine to diplomatic, were abundant. And when reporters tried to interrupt the unexpected buddy movie that emerged in the White House on Friday, President Trump warmly placed his hand on Zohran Mamdani’s arm and gently advised him to keep it simple in response to a question about whether Mr. Mamdani considered him a fascist. “You can just say yes,” the president said. “It’s easier.” It was an astonishingly affectionate performance that sent heads spinning, as New Yorkers confronted the once-unthinkable possibility that Mr. Mamdani, the democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City, and the president actually got along. “I mean, it did seem like a little bit of a bromance,” said Nicole Malliotakis, the...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/nyregion/mamdani-trump-reaction-meeting.html,22/11/2025

Trump’s Russia Sanctions Shift War Dynamics to the Energy Front - The New York Times,"As winter slows the pace of battlefield combat, Moscow and Kyiv are betting on campaigns against each other’s energy assets to break a stalemate in the conflict. Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine Far from the largely deadlocked front line on the battlefield, Russia and Ukraine are waging a fierce parallel war on each other’s energy assets that could do more to force them to the negotiating table than any flurry of international diplomacy. This fight came into focus in recent days as the United States and Europe announced sweeping new sanctions on Russia’s oil industry, the lifeblood of the Kremlin’s war machine. Ukraine has been working to rally international action against Russia’s energy economy, while imposing what it calls its own “long-range sanctions”: drone strikes that have damaged dozens of Russian refineries. Russia’s target is the Ukrainian electricity and gas infrastructure, which it has attacked repeatedly in a devastating campaign as winter approaches.

Aleksandr heard the whine of an approaching Russian drone. A Ukrainian infantryman on a four-soldier foot patrol, he was picking his way at 2 a.m. through the waist-high vegetation of an August meadow. A high-pitched whir rose in the moonless quiet. An armed multicopter had detected them and was maneuvering to attack. Now luck would influence fates. The soldiers were on a mission to string wire across the forlorn emptiness between opposing trench lines, creating obstacles to entangle Russian infantry and strip invaders on motocross bikes from their seats.

"Eli Lilly, Drug Maker of Zepbound and Mounjaro, Reaches $1 Trillion in Value - The New York Times","The 150-year-old drugmaker is the first company in health care to hit the milestone. Eli Lilly, the maker of hugely popular weight loss drugs, has reached $1 trillion in value, becoming the first publicly traded company in health care to hit the milestone. Lilly’s stock has surged in large part because of the company’s success in seizing the biggest potential market in the history of the drug industry: the class of weight loss medicines known as GLP-1s. The company’s injection, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, is on track to be the top-selling drug in the world this year. Only a handful of publicly traded companies, mostly in technology, have reached the $1 trillion benchmark.

How Olivia Nuzzi and Ryan Lizza Became Main Characters on Social Media - The New York Times,"Love, politics and ethics collided as Olivia Nuzzi and Ryan Lizza went at it in a media sphere that rewards private revelations. It felt like something out of Spy magazine in the 1980s, or Gawker in the first years of the new millennium — a media scandal drenched in sex, politics, secrets and self-dramatization. Olivia Nuzzi and Ryan Lizza, political writers who had a habit of making news both before and after they were engaged to each other, were in near unavoidable circulation this week, overwhelming social media and the universe of Amtrak’s Northeast corridor. These two products of legacy media, who once covered people in power for major publications, now find themselves hustling for attention in an environment where nothing gets you noticed like salacious self-revelation.

Venezuela Doesn’t Produce Fentanyl. Trump Is Targeting It Anyway. - The New York Times,"Lawmakers and narcotics experts say that the Trump administration’s efforts to tie Venezuela to the U.S. fentanyl crisis are misleading. Reporting from Washington President Trump has said that the U.S. military is attacking boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific because of the large numbers of fentanyl deaths in the United States, and he claims that those boats come from Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the military mission “secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people.” The U.S. military has blown up at least 21 boats, killing more than 80 people since the Trump administration’s antidrug campaign began in September. There is little doubt that fentanyl is exceptionally dangerous. But lawmakers and narcotics experts say that the Trump administration’s efforts to tie Venezuela to the U.S. fentanyl crisis are misleading.

How ‘The Beatles Anthology’ Got Gen X Hooked on the Fab Four - The New York Times,"Young people coming of age in the Fab Four’s shadow rolled their eyes at the band’s boomer bona fides. The “Anthology,” now back after 30 years, changed all that. Growing up, I hated the Beatles. Well, hate is a strong word. As a teenager in the 1980s and ’90s, I was exhausted by them. The Beatles represented my parents’ generation, and their inescapable songs felt like the musical embodiment of boomer dominance. The proper Gen X rejection of the Fab Four seemed best expressed by the punk sneer of the Nation of Ulysses in 1992: “I’m not talking ’bout a Beatles song / Written a hundred years before I was born.” What caused my attitude to shift — from curiosity to, eventually, obsession — was “The Beatles Anthology” in 1995, an in-depth, self-produced TV documentary, along with three related CD sets stuffed with alternate studio goodies. An expanded 30th-anniversary version of the series, with refreshed visuals and audio, is coming to Disney+ starting on Nov. 26.

Opinion | Trump Faces a Lame-Duck Economy - The New York Times,"When Donald Trump’s approval ratings dropped sharply last April, the wound was essentially self-inflicted and the prescription relatively simple: Dial it back. Meaning smaller and less destructive tariffs, a retreat from brinkmanship with the Supreme Court, less random hacking away at government programs by Elon Musk and Co. The administration did chill out, to some degree. Musk departed, the tariffs diminished from their “Liberation Day” maximum, the White House stopped shipping people to the Salvadoran dungeon and began picking its judicial battles more carefully. And sure enough, Trump’s approval ratings bobbed back up. But now he’s down again, to the lowest point of this presidency, with the generic ballot threatening a midterm blood bath for his party. And this time the prescription is less obvious, the trend harder to reverse. Not that some of the damage isn’t self-inflicted, as it always is with Trump — from the Jeffrey Epstein stonewall to the botched handling of the shutdown...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/22/opinion/trump-economy-lame-duck.html,22/11/2025
"‘Fascist’? ‘Communist’?

There was one moment in particular when Zohran Mamdani seemed like he might have bit off a little more than he could chew by making his lonely pilgrimage down to the lion’s den that is President Trump’s blinged-out Oval Office. The 34-year-old mayor-elect of New York was pressed by a reporter if he thought his host, who was sitting about four inches away, was really “a fascist.” How terribly awkward. But before Mr. Mamdani could even get out one of his slick and diplomatic answers, the president jumped in to throw him a lifeline. “That’s OK, you could just say, ‘Yes,’” Mr. Trump said, looking highly amused by the whole thing. He waved his hand, as if being called the worst term in the political dictionary was no big deal. “OK, all right,” Mr. Mamdani said with a smile. “It’s easier,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s easier than explaining it.” Chuckling good-naturedly, he reached up and gave Mr....",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/trump-mamdani-scene.html,22/11/2025

A faculty panel ruled unanimously against the termination. A Texas A&M University appeals panel has unanimously ruled that the school was “not justified” when it fired a lecturer who had been accused of teaching a course that recognized more than two genders. The decision does not guarantee that the lecturer, Melissa McCoul, will be reinstated. But the ruling puts pressure on the university’s administration as it decides a matter that put Texas A&M at the center of the nation’s rancorous debate about what can be taught in classrooms. Dr. McCoul was teaching an English department course, “Literature for Children,” in College Station when a student filmed a depiction of a “gender unicorn,” which is used to explain the differences between gender expression and gender identity.

What Is Trump’s 28-Point Plan to End Russia’s War in Ukraine? - The New York Times,"President Trump is pressing Kyiv to accept an outcome that yields to President Vladimir V. Putin’s demands. By Paul Sonne and Ivan Nechepurenko Paul Sonne reported from Berlin, and Ivan Nechepurenko from St. Petersburg, Russia. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said a 28-point plan that President Trump is pressuring Ukraine to accept could “serve as a foundation for a final peace agreement.” It would also be a big victory for the Russian leader, placing limits on Western power, forcing Ukraine to cede territory it hasn’t lost on the battlefield, restricting the size of its military and ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, whom Mr. Trump has given until Thursday to accept the plan, warned that his country faced “one of the most difficult moments in its history.” It is a U.S.-backed peace proposal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine that would have Ukraine capitulate on most of Mr. Putin’s demands.

Has the College Football Playoff made that even truer? Ron Johnson / Imagn Images About 20 years ago, a friend of mine who had a lot more money than I did invited me and my then-partner on a trip through the Caribbean on his father’s private boat. It was the sort of indulgent voyage that I’m hesitant to even bring up in public, lest I be one of the first people taken out when the revolution comes, but suffice it to say, it was the sort of top-shelf vacation I haven’t taken since. The thing about a trip like that is, even if it’s the only one you take in your entire life, it stops feeling like an aberration or an indulgence about halfway through. You can’t help but have the illusion that this is somehow normal.

Soobum Im / Getty Images Let’s be honest: This weekend is not a great lineup of games. Some of that is due to bloated conferences resulting in less meaningful matchups. Some of it is open weeks. And some of it is the SEC’s late-season, nonconference cupcakes.

Where can the soul of college football still be found? Check the tailgate lots - The Athletic,"(Joseph Weiser / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) One of the best encapsulations of modern college football is, of course, in a commercial.

Before you tell the husband, could you talk to your ex? Read more Leading questions I left my ex-husband two and a half years ago. He told me the day we broke up that he had feelings for a married woman and she for him. I knew. It was part of the reason I wanted to leave him, along with a very long list of ways in which our marriage was no longer serving either of us. A few months later he started actively (but covertly) pursuing this woman, who is a mum in my son’s sports team. Apart from my ex and this woman, I am pretty sure I am the only person who knows. I feel complicit in their awful lie and I feel sick knowing that it will hurt a lot of people. My son is 17 and his soccer team is like an extended family.

Rob Edwards returns to Wolves aware taking his dream job has let Boro down | Wolverhampton Wanderers | The Guardian,"Club are bottom of the Premier League and winless, but new head coach is delighted to be back In a cosy room off the reception at Wolves’ Compton training base, Rob Edwards is reminded he is back talking at the top table where, nine years ago, he struggled to conceal his excitement at being in caretaker charge of the club. “Was that when I had to sort of say I didn’t want the job and had to be really diplomatic?” he says, smiling. This is the real thing after jumping at the chance to take permanent charge despite the club being bottom of the Premier League with two points from 11 matches and possessing the ignominious record of being the only winless team in the top seven tiers of English football. No Premier League team have recovered from such a poor start to retain their top-flight status, but Edwards is pleased to be back and has belief in achieving the seemingly impossible.

Influencers made millions pushing ‘wild’ births – now the Free Birth Society is linked to baby deaths around the world | Childbirth | The Guardian,"A year-long investigation reveals how mothers lost children after being radicalised by uplifting podcast tales of births without midwives or doctors As Esau Lopez was asphyxiated for the first 17 minutes of his life on Earth, the atmosphere in the room remained serene, even ecstatic. Acoustic music crooned from a speaker in a modest two-bedroom apartment in a suburb of Pennsylvania. “You are a queen,” murmured one of three friends in the room. Only Esau’s mother, Gabrielle Lopez, felt something was wrong. She was pushing hard, but her son would not be born. “Can you help [him] out?” she asked, as Esau crowned. “Baby is coming,” the friend replied. Four minutes later, Lopez asked again, “Can you grab [him]?” Another friend murmured, “Baby is safe.” Six minutes passed.

Zak Crawley’s awkward prod sends England down another terminal spiral | Ashes 2025-26 | The Guardian,"This team refuse on a point of principle to rein themselves in but latest batting collapse lays bare glaring weaknesses It is the UK that is living through a cold snap, but in balmy Perth they were playing in a snow globe. The scenery was static, solid, but everything else was constantly getting shaken up, bits flying in unpredictable directions. The crowd roared, commentators gibbered, the glitter never settled. Unlike the first day England were not batting at the start, though they were not long delayed. At which point a pattern quickly emerged, one that almost perfectly repeated that established on the previous day, while also being completely different. The bowler who was useless was good, the marginal, unconvincing snickometer-based review that was not out was now given.

Gabriel is a big loss for Arsenal – Arteta’s conundrum is how to replace him | Arsenal | The Guardian,"Cristhian Mosquera, Piero Hincapié or Riccardo Calafiori could start against Spurs, but none can replicate what the Brazilian offers in defence and attack Sometimes it is not just about the numbers. Mikel Arteta probably put it best when he was asked to summarise how influential Gabriel Magalhães has been to his Arsenal side so far this season prior to their meeting with Crystal Palace last month. “His belief is tremendous,” said the manager. “I can tell him to go and run to the first post, and he does it with conviction, energy and attitude. The team’s belief in those moments is really high, and Gabriel is at the heart of that. He gives everything for the team and that sets the tone for everyone else.” So Arteta must have feared the worst when the 27-year-old trudged off with his shirt over his face in Brazil’s win over Senegal at the Emirates Stadium last weekend.

‘The flowing red saree on the bank of the Ganges was incredibly striking’: Divyanshu Verma’s best phone picture | Photography | The Guardian,"The Indian photographer captured a quiet moment at the popular Maha Kumbh Mela religious festival in Prayagraj Divyanshu Verma regards the north Indian city of Prayagraj as deeply special: not only is it home, it is also where he began his journey into street photography. This image was taken in the Sangam area during the huge Hindu purification festival Maha Kumbh Mela – maha meaning great because this was the 12th in a row of the ritual that takes place once every 12 years. “It’s a massive spiritual gathering and the energy is entirely unique,” Verma says. “The place was incredibly crowded with people who had travelled from far and wide, all drawn by faith, but there was a strange sense of calm within the chaos.

Trump may yet impose a Ukraine deal – but it threatens to be a disaster for Kyiv | Ukraine | The Guardian,"Ukraine could be forced into an agreement but plan as it stands seems too bizarre for Zelenskyy to sell to his public We’ve been here before: the Trump administration announces a roadmap towards peace in Ukraine that seems to be dramatically skewed towards Moscow’s demands; Volodymyr Zelenskyy gets on the phone to alarmed European allies; they quickly call Trump to message him that the whole idea is unworkable; the plan quietly dies. Rinse and repeat. This time it feels a bit different, however. Reports on Friday suggested the US has threatened that if Ukraine does not sign a hastily concocted peace plan, Washington could withdraw intelligence-sharing and other support critical to the Ukrainian war effort. Zelenskyy addressed the nation, saying Ukraine was faced with a choice of “losing our dignity or the risk of losing our key partner”.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and trade representative Jamieson Greer will hold high-level meetings in Brussels on Monday with ministers, EU commissioners and industry bosses. The face-to-face meetings are the first talks since the six-week US government shutdown that began at the start of October. In a high-risk move, Lutnick and Greer have been invited to lunch with 27 trade ministers who are gathering for a summit on Monday.

Far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro arrested in Brazil | Jair Bolsonaro | The Guardian,"Politician reportedly taken from his villa into custody at a federal police base about 7 miles from presidential palace Brazil’s former far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been arrested at his villa in the capital, Brasília. In a brief statement, federal police confirmed officers had executed a preventive arrest warrant at the request of the supreme court. Brazilian media reports said the politician had been taken to a federal police base, seven miles from the presidential palace Bolsonaro occupied from 2019 until 2022, when he lost the election and tried to launch a military coup. It was not immediately clear why the court had ordered the preventive arrest of the 70-year-old former president, although local reports said it had been done to “maintain public order”.

"Tottenham not close to spending £100m on one player like Arsenal, says Frank | Tottenham Hotspur | The Guardian","Manager optimistic he will be backed by board ‘Invest cleverly and we want to do it smart’ Thomas Frank has said Tottenham are not close to emulating Arsenal by spending £100m on one player. Spurs have experienced a period of change after September’s removal of Daniel Levy as chair and the decision by the Lewis family, who own the club, to put a new leadership team in place. Plans to expand the business are intended to lead to more sporting success, but it remains to be seen whether they can take the next step and challenge Arsenal for the Premier League title. Arsenal, top going into Sunday’s north London derby, showed their intent when they bought Declan Rice from West Ham for £105m in 2023. Spurs’ record buy is the £60m Richarlison in 2022. Frank is unsure whether his predecessor, Ange Postecoglou, was right to predict last year that Spurs will never spend £100m on one player. “In the next 50 years?” he said. “Then yes. “To build, you need a combination of time and doing the...",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/21/tottenham-thomas-frank-100-million-arsenal,21/11/2025
‘There are many zoos I would like to see closed’: world zoo chief plans shake-up | Zoos | The Guardian,"As debate continues to rage over the welfare of animals in captivity, David Field is hoping to drag the sector forward He has loved zoos all his life, but would close many of them down if he could. David Field, who this month became head of the world’s zoo industry group, said of zoos that treat animals badly: “It makes me feel desperate. I’ve probably in my life tried to close down more zoos than open them.” He’s taken up the mantle of keeping the world’s zoos in check at an interesting time, when their role in modern society is the subject of heated debate, with rows about lonely gorillas or penguins kept in a basement seeming to erupt every week. Keeping wild animals solely for entertainment purposes was socially acceptable some decades ago, but there are now far more concerns for their welfare and the conservation objectives of their captivity.

Bro boost: women say their LinkedIn traffic increases if they pretend to be men | LinkedIn | The Guardian,"Collective experiment found switching profile to ‘male’ and ‘bro-coding’ text led to big increase in reach, though site denies favouring posts by men Do your LinkedIn followers consider you a “thought leader”? Do hordes of commenters applaud your tips on how to “scale” your startup? Do recruiters slide into your DMs to “explore potential synergies”? If not, it could be because you’re not a man.

South Africa’s dispute with US escalates amid row over G20 handover event | G20 | The Guardian,"Trump press secretary accuses Cyril Ramaphosa of ‘running his mouth’ after US boycott of summit in Johannesburg The dispute between South Africa and the US over the Trump administration’s decision to boycott the G20 in Johannesburg has continued, with South Africa objecting to a US plan for a junior embassy official to take part in the closing ceremony meant to mark the handover to the next summit, which will take place in Florida. The two-day summit, which opens on Saturday, comes at a febrile moment in global politics. The US has proposed a deal to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which it agreed with Moscow without the involvement of Ukraine or the EU.

"In the midterms, Republicans will be footing the bill for Trump’s policies | Sidney Blumenthal | The Guardian","The abject obedience of GOP members for the president has not augured well in the 4 November elections The elections of 4 November were the end of a grandiose illusion. After his 2024 victory Donald Trump claimed he had an “unprecedented and powerful mandate”, that his “mandate” was “massive”, and that his “Maga movement” was irresistible, the wave of the future. It lasted 10 months, in which he had betrayed his chief promise to lower inflation, turned the public against him on every issue and Republicans at last faced a battering by voters. Trump’s image of omnipotence has rested upon a pyramid of dread. His ability to maintain the servility of the Republican Congress, whose members are intimidated by the danger that if they defy him he would support primary opponents to run against them, has been the political foundation for all the other forms of fear he incites throughout American institutions.

New Caledonia activist says France is impeding travel home after prison release | New Caledonia | The Guardian,"Exclusive: Kanak leader Christian Tein, who was freed from prison in June, says France is ‘deliberately dragging out’ re-issue of his passport A pro-independence leader from the French overseas territory of New Caledonia has accused the French government of “deliberately dragging out” his passport application, preventing him from flying home after his release from prison. Christian Tein, an Indigenous Kanak leader, was arrested in New Caledonia in June 2024 over allegations that he had instigated the deadly pro-independence protests that had taken place on the island a month earlier. He was charged with various offences, including complicity in attempted murder and organised theft with a weapon, all of which he denied. Tein was then flown to France, 10,600 miles away, on a private chartered plane and incarcerated until June of this year.

"Goblets of borscht, turkey-shaped madeleines: why Martha Stewart’s fantastical menus are still an inspiration | Christmas food and drink | The Guardian","The lifestyle guru’s advice on 1980s entertaining was absurd – but reminds us that hosting should always be fun The celebrations were imminent and the greenhouse ready to accommodate – among the orchids, in unseasonable November warmth – an intimate Hawaiian luau. The table was set with giant clam shells for serving vessels and miniature hibachis for grilling Dungeness crab. Somebody had found a small, pink pineapple and secured it on the watermelon like a brooch. The hostess considered the merits of a hula dancer, but in the end settled on a more succinct spectacle: a 19lb suckling pig, enwreathed with sub-tropical flowers and caparisoned in bronze. It was, and could only ever have been, a Martha Stewart affair. This was before the media empire, in more innocent days, when Stewart was a caterer in Connecticut. She was brilliant even then.

‘I’ll stick up for you’: key moments from the cordial Trump-Mamdani meeting | Donald Trump | The Guardian,"The president hosted the mayor-elect at the White House – and seemed enamoured of his fellow New Yorker The highly anticipated Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani – the mayor-elect of New York City, the US president’s beloved home town – was hardly the combustible tête-à-tête many had predicted. For the moment at least, the two New Yorkers appeared friendly, smiling and cautiously optimistic about the work they might accomplish together. Neither revived their hot campaign trail rhetoric, in which they cast each other as diametrically opposed political adversaries. Trump had labeled Mamdani a “100% Communist Lunatic” and urged voters to back his opponent, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. In turn, Mamdani had assailed Trump as a “despot” and pledged to be the president’s “worst nightmare”. Here are five things that stood out from their surprising display of political bonhomie.

Gary ‘Mani’ Mounfield obituary | Indie | The Guardian,"Charismatic Stone Roses and Primal Scream musician acclaimed for some of the most memorable bass lines in indie music The Stone Roses’ eponymous debut album, released in May 1989, became a benchmark British record by blending anthemic, 1960s-evoking melodies and chiming guitar work with what Rolling Stone’s David Fricke described as “the blown-mind drive of British rave culture”. While John Squire took care of the band’s Byrds-like jangling guitar, it was Mani, who has died aged 63, who played the powerful, hard-edged bass lines that put the rocket fuel into tracks such as She Bangs the Drums and This Is the One. The first sound you hear on the disc is his bass emerging, both tantalisingly and menacingly, through the sonic fog at the start of I Wanna Be Adored. It was a mixture that helped redefine the band’s home city of Manchester as “Madchester”, a place that had magically become “baggydelic”, through a club-indie crossover scene that emerged out of venues such as the Hacienda and...",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/gary-mani-mounfield-obituary,21/11/2025
"Ukraine war briefing: defeating Russia an ‘illusion’, says Putin, as he welcomes Trump deal | Russia | The Guardian","Russia’s president says US-led plan ‘could form the basis of a final peace settlement’, bolstering concerns in Europe about one-sided nature of US-brokered deal. What we know on day 1,368 See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage Vladimir Putin says Ukraine is being unrealistic if it does not accept the US plan to end the war, declaring: “Ukraine is against it. Apparently, Ukraine and its European allies are still under illusions and dream of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield”. The positive response from the Russian president adds weight to the views of European and Ukrainian officials that the deal amounts to a “capitulation”. Addressing Russia’s national security council, Putin called the 28-point plan “a new version” and “a modernised plan” of what was discussed with the US ahead of his Alaska summit with Donald Trump in August, and said Moscow has received it.

Group of Epstein abuse survivors say they have received death threats | Jeffrey Epstein | The Guardian,"In a signed statement, 28 victims say they are bracing for blame for their abuse and threats of harm A group of survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse have warned they have received death threats and are worried about an escalation as they wait for the release of the files related to the late paedophile financier. In a statement titled “What we’re bracing for”, the women said they had received threats of harm and asked police to investigate and protect them. Several women who were abused by Epstein have ramped up their campaigning efforts in recent weeks to push for the release of the justice department’s files related the late sex offender. Some have spoken publicly about their ordeals, putting themselves at the forefront of a scandal that has dominated the national conversation in the US as a rare Republican rebellion saw Donald Trump drop his opposition to a move to release the files and sign it into law.

Who knew it would take an American pope to remind us of the value of art and good taste? | Jason Okundaye | The Guardian,"Anti-AI and pro-beauty, Leo XIV has proved an unlikely custodian of culture – and a patron of meaningful work in a world of algorithmic slop So, who figured that Pope Leo XIV would end up being kind of cool? Not me. Although as a lapsed Catholic I had little stake in the conclave race, I felt that there was something unglamorous, dare I say godless, about a first-ever supreme pontiff born in the US, let alone one hailing from Chicago, the same city as Hugh Hefner, Hillary Clinton and Kanye West. There were greater apprehensions beyond taste, too. Would this finally be the ordination of the reinvigorated Maga movement after the death of the compassionate Pope Francis? When Leo appeared on the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica wearing the traditional red mozzetta cape eschewed by his predecessor, it was too easy to jump to conclusions. By the grace of God, the red mozzetta was a red herring.

‘We’ve been eating it for more than 100 years’: how one community turns stink bug infestations into lunch | Food | The Guardian,"In India’s Mizoram state, people have an intricate system of harvesting and consuming the pungent and nutritious bugs Every few years when Udonga montana, a bamboo-feeding stink bug, erupts in massive swarms, the people of the Mizo community in northern India don’t reach for pesticides. Instead, they look for baskets. Locally, this small brown stink bug is called thangnang. Outsiders see them as an infestation but in the bamboo forests of Mizoram state this small brown bug has long been woven into the food culture. Drawing on generations of traditional ecological knowledge, the Mizo people have developed an intricate system of harvesting, processing and consuming the insects that not only provides high-protein nutrition but also helps control pest populations without harming the forest with pesticides. “We have been eating thangnang for more than 100 years,” says Salemkulhthangi, an elder from the Serhmun village. “I remember my father telling stories of how they used to collect it.”...",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/21/turning-stink-bug-infestations-into-lunch-india-the-alternatives,21/11/2025

Take our quiz | Ultra-processed foods | The Guardian,"Test your knowledge in eight questions to prove you know your onions from your emulsifiers A major global report released this week linked ultra-processed foods to harm in every major human organ. For people in the US, the UK and Australia, these foods make up more than half the calories they consume each day. But it’s not always easy to tell which foods are ultra-processed. The term was coined in 2009 by researchers at the University of São Paulo, as part of their Nova food classification system that sorts foods into four groups: Group one: unprocessed or minimally processed foods including whole fruits and vegetables, milk, oats and rice. Group two: processed basic ingredients used in cooking including salt, sugar and vegetable oils. Group three: processed foods made by adding items from groups one and two.

Beating Pumas could open pivotal chapter in England’s 2027 World Cup story | Autumn Nations Series | The Guardian,"Defeat of Argentina in 2000 was important stepping stone for Clive Woodward’s side on way to winning ultimate prize It is exactly 25 years since the most fraught pre-match buildup in the history of English international rugby union. In this same week in November 2000 a pay row led to the entire national side walking out on strike, prompting Clive Woodward to threaten that an alternative team of lower-league amateurs would be chosen if his players did not return to training by 11am the following morning. After a tense standoff they duly did so, a grudging truce was agreed and the weekend game against Argentina went ahead with England winning 19-0. Three years later all but two of that matchday squad (the exceptions were David Flatman and Matt Perry) were lifting the Rugby World Cup in Australia. The moral of the “strike” story?

What’s that?” your classmate would ask, their nose wrinkling as they took in yesterday’s veggie curry, crumbling homemade falafel or – my mother’s speciality – a “deconstructed sandwich” of doorstop-thick fresh bread, filling of some kind (often cucumber) and attendant crumbs floating freely in the bag.

In part this is because the pictures from Donald Trump’s state dinner with Mohammed bin Salman and his in-house hype men Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino were everywhere, recycled feverishly across the internet, dusted with their own drool-stained commentary by the wider Ronaldo-verse.

But anyone expecting to see fists fly and shirts torn in the Oval Office was in for a disappointment. Trump, 79, and 34-year-old Mamdani actually got on rather well.

Only $11.3bn of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria’s $18bn (£14bn) targeted budget for 2026 to 2028 has been confirmed so far. Leading past donors, including France, Japan and the European Commission, failed to offer specific amounts at a pledging summit on the fringes of the G20 in South Africa. The US promised up to $4.6bn. This would still make it the fund’s leading donor, but it is a drop from its $6bn pledge in the last funding round.

It’s interesting and instructive to reflect on what German newspaper readers made of the column in the early years of the new millennium, nearly two decades on from the fall of the Berlin Wall. For while Erpenbeck adopted some of the features of the form – apparently throwaway observations on daily life, such as minor irritation at the difficulty of sourcing proper splitterbrötchen, an unpretentious pastry now pimped for a more elaborate and wealthy clientele – she consistently enlarged and complicated it.

Ben Stokes will doubtless push back at that notion, such is his refusal to ever throw in the towel.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine has impossible choice as Trump pushes plan to end war | Ukraine | The Guardian,"US president demands that Kyiv accepts plan that would mean giving up territory to Russia Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine faces one of the most difficult moments in its history, after Donald Trump demanded Kyiv accepts within days a US-backed “peace plan” that would force it to give up territory to Russia and make other painful concessions. Trump confirmed on Friday morning that next Thursday – Thanksgiving in the US – would be an “acceptable” deadline for Zelenskyy to sign the deal, which European and Ukrainian officials have said amounts to a “capitulation”.

Trump’s Ukraine peace plan is a gift to Putin | Kenneth Roth | The Guardian,"The plan would leave Ukraine’s democracy in jeopardy and its sovereignty compromised For a moment, Donald Trump seemed to have seen the light on Ukraine. After promising “severe consequences” in August if Vladimir Putin continued to obstruct ceasefire talks – but then doing nothing as Putin did just that – Trump finally on 22 October imposed significant sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, seriously compromising Putin’s ability to finance his invasion. But now, with his 28-point peace plan for Ukraine, drafted by US and Russian officials without Ukrainian or European participation, Trump has reverted to his pro-Putin norm. Trump’s plan would reward Putin for invading Ukraine while leaving Ukraine’s democracy in jeopardy. The plan’s ringing proclamation that “Ukraine’s sovereignty will be confirmed” rings hollow when so much of the plan compromises that sovereignty.

The foundations of informed democratic debate are under attack across the globe from a combination of AI-generated deepfakes, hostile state propaganda and algorithms that amplify divisions through social media. We have already seen how Elon Musk, the wealthiest man on the planet, is prepared to use his own social media platform, X, to interfere in the affairs of other countries and exert a chilling influence on democracies.

Golovkin to be elected World Boxing president and lead buildup to 2028 Olympics | Boxing | The Guardian,"Former world champion promises to restore trust in sport World Boxing replaced IBA as governing body this year The former world middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin is to be elected president of World Boxing and lead the sport as it heads towards the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics. Golovkin, who won Olympic silver in Athens in 2004 and went on to make the most world title defences in middleweight history, is the only presidential candidate approved by the sport’s independent vetting panel for Sunday’s election. As a result he will take charge of World Boxing, which became the governing body for amateur Olympic boxing this year. That role used to be held by the International Boxing Association but it was banished by the International Olympic Committee in 2023 after a series of judging, corruption and governance scandals. In his manifesto, the 43-year-old Golovkin, whose initial term runs until 2027, promised to restore trust in the sport and secure boxing’s long-term place in the Olympic...",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/21/gennady-golovkin-elected-world-boxing-president-los-angeles-olympics-2028,21/11/2025
Daily Mail owner strikes £500m deal to buy Telegraph titles | Telegraph Media Group | The Guardian,"Acquisition likely to trigger in-depth investigation by regulator after agreement between DMGT and Redbird IMI The owner of the Daily Mail has struck a £500m deal to buy the Telegraph titles, in a move that will create a right-leaning publishing powerhouse. Lord Rothermere’s Daily Mail & General Trust (DMGT) has entered a period of exclusivity with RedBird IMI, which has been seeking a buyer since being forced to put the papers up for sale last spring, to complete the terms of the transaction. The two parties say they expect this process to “happen quickly”, however the deal is likely to trigger an in-depth investigation by the media regulator Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

Not just for Paddington: is the humble duffel coat having a fashion moment? | Fashion | The Guardian,"Worn by everyone from Tyler, the Creator to Cole Palmer and Joe Wilkinson, duffels are back in demand It’s the coat most associated with a beloved children’s character, so it makes sense that the duffel is a familiar sight in playgrounds across the country. But this year it is also – once again – quietly enjoying a moment on grownups. In the Christmas advert for Waitrose, comedian Joe Wilkinson wears a duffel coat while in the supermarket with Keira Knightley. Footballer Cole Palmer wore one in 2024’s Burberry campaign, subtitled “It’s Always Burberry Weather”, and Tyler, the Creator wears a short one in the recent video for Darling, I. Meanwhile, Paddington Bear is sporting his on stage in the West End at the moment. Duffel coats are on the high street too, from a £279 cream design in Labrum’s range for John Lewis to a £64 checked design at Marks & Spencer, a fashion favourite.

The sit-down – which many had anticipated would be contentious, given months of intense rhetoric in which Trump branded Mamdani a “communist lunatic” – instead produced camaraderie, warm words and concrete pledges of cooperation between the Republican president and the self-described democratic socialist who secured a commanding electoral victory earlier at the beginning of...",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/donald-trump-zohran-mamdani-meeting,21/11/2025
Rachel Reeves is studiously ignoring the cause of Britain’s woes: the Brexit-shaped hole in the roof | Jonathan Freedland | The Guardian,"The autumn budget will mop up some damage, but the true source of the economic crisis is clear. The government should now fix it – don’t hold your breath Imagine a family stuck in a house that constantly floods. The carpets are soaked, the walls damp. It’s always cold, no matter how much they turn up the heating. The family try everything. They promise to replace the sodden carpets and find new, innovative ways to warm the house. Someone with a laptop wonders if AI might be the answer. But no one ever looks upwards and says: maybe we should just repair the giant hole in the roof. Britons are that family – and the giant hole in the roof is Brexit. On Wednesday, Rachel Reeves will deliver her second budget, on which, it is widely assumed, the fate of an ailing Labour government depends.

‘Justin Bieber is an insanely courageous artist’: Tobias Jesso Jr on how he became the songwriter to the stars | Pop and rock | The Guardian,"He has penned hits for Adele, Dua Lipa and Bieber, but the sought-after Canadian pop songwriter has only ever released one album himself. Now, 10 years on, comes a second –and it’s a scorching account of a breakup Goon, the 2015 debut album by Canada-born LA musician Tobias Jesso Jr, was one of the revelations of the 2010s. An album of heartfelt, earnest ballads in the vein of 70s singer-songwriters such as Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson, it instantly established Jesso as a rising indie star and was one of the year’s most acclaimed records. The problem was that Jesso didn’t care much for the attention: he struggled to feel like a genuine performer, leading him to drink heavily before shows, and felt he was playing a version of himself in interviews. “I was forced to do all these things I wasn’t really confident in,” he says. “I was just like … I don’t know what I’m doing, anywhere.” So, toward the end of his breakout year, he cancelled all future shows and, in essence, put his career...",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/tobias-jesso-jr-interview-songwriter-shine-dua-lipa-justin-bieber-adele,21/11/2025
‘The public has been lied to’: secretly made documentary insists that aliens exist | Documentary films | The Guardian,"The Age of Disclosure is a new film featuring high-ranking government officials who claim proof of extraterrestrial life has been covered up Director Dan Farah grew up with aliens. As a child of the 80s and 90s, pop culture was awash with extra-terrestrial sightings. “How can you be a kid watching movies like ET and Close Encounters, TV shows like The X Files, and not end up curious about whether or not we’re alone in the universe?” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “And whether or not the US government does, in fact, hold secrets from the public.” Farah’s exposure to otherworldly beings in fiction kickstarted an interest that’s now morphed into a professional quest, and the subject of his documentary debut The Age of Disclosure.

Greek secondary school teachers to be trained in using AI in classroom | Greece | The Guardian,"Some teachers and pupils voice concerns about pilot programme after government’s agreement with OpenAI Secondary school teachers in Greece are set to go through an intensive course in using artificial intelligence tools as the country assumes a frontline role in incorporating AI into its education system. Next week, staff in 20 schools will be trained in a specialised version of ChatGPT, custom-made for academic institutions, under a new agreement between the centre-right government and OpenAI. “We have to accept that AI does not exist in a parallel universe. It is here,” the education minister, Sofia Zacharaki, said ahead of the pilot programme launch.

"Voters could abandon centrist parties if budget fails, warns former cabinet secretary | Budget 2025 | The Guardian","Simon Case says voters will look elsewhere if chancellor cannot find solutions to tax, spending and debt problems Voters will look elsewhere if Rachel Reeves does not use next week’s pivotal budget to show that “centre-ground” politicians can fix the UK’s entrenched economic problems, the former head of the civil service, Simon Case, has said. Case told the Guardian that at the time of last year’s general election, when he was still cabinet secretary, he believed Labour would be forced to break its manifesto promise to not raise taxes because of the state of the public finances. The buildup to Rachel Reeves’s set-piece fiscal speech has been dramatic, with the chancellor briefing heavily that she would be forced to breach the Labour manifesto and raise income tax, before the Treasury suddenly rowed back on the idea. Instead, she is expected to seek more revenue through a suite of changes, including possible levies on gambling, and potentially a freeze on income tax thresholds – a de...",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/nov/21/budget-2025-centrists-uk-economy-civil-service-warning,21/11/2025

Not a problem. Fake fringes are everywhere – and I tried one out The 70s had “the Fawcett.” In the 90s it was all about “the Rachel.” But now there’s a new era-defining hair cut. “The Claudia.” Yes, the glossy inky-black block fringe that mostly shrouds the face of its owner, the presenter Claudia Winkleman, has become a seminal moment on and off TV screens. It is a fringe that has spawned memes, online forums dedicated to debating its length and a fan account on X. “Thoughts and opinions from the highest paid fringe on the BBC” reads the bio. Alan Carr has described it, not Winkleman, as a national treasure. While Winkleman’s signature Traitors style, including her chunky roll-necks and fingerless gloves, is easily emulated, her fringe is a little trickier.

The Disneyfication of F1: Goofy in the pitlane and Fantasia in Vegas underline sport’s US transformation | Formula One 2025 | The Guardian,"As little as a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that an American institution such as Disney would have chosen to hitch its wagon to F1 The remarkable nature of the transformation in Formula One’s fortunes in the United States could not have been better illustrated than by the incongruous sight of Mickey Mouse and an assortment of his Disney pals leading a gang of enthusiastic fans on a walk down the pit lane at the Las Vegas Grand Prix. F1 successfully hosting a race in Sin City and the US now boasting three sellout meetings is testament to the sport’s burgeoning prosperity. For all of the somewhat surreal edge of seeing Donald Duck and Goofy outside garages, the fact Disney has chosen F1 as a partner is indicative of the sea change the sport has brought about in a market it has long coveted.

Then, I hear the birdsong and the rustling of the palm trees. The harsh sun dims and there’s water and the smell of damp earth. It’s easy to understand why desert travellers yearned to reach these havens and why they have become synonymous with peace. I’m an explorer who’s walked through many oases with loaded camels, crossing Morocco and the Sahara on foot, but Skoura, a four-hour drive from Marrakech, is a place I visit to decompress. You may be imagining some kind of cartoon mirage oasis – a sole date palm shimmering above the endless sands. In fact, Skoura has a population of around 3,000 people living in a small town on the edge of the palms with 10 sq miles (25 sq km) of agricultural land.

The Cop30 president, André Corrêa do Lago, urged ministers and high-ranking officials from more than 190 countries to find common ground: “We need to preserve this regime [of the Paris climate agreement] with the spirit of cooperation, not in the spirit of who is going to win or is willing to lose’” he said. “Because we know if we don’t strengthen this, everyone will lose.” No agreement looked likely, however, on the core issue of a “transition away from fossil fuels”, with the conference split into two large blocs.

The British driver’s march to the title looks increasingly likely with pole at what has been a bogey circuit for McLaren. Norris beat the Red Bull of Max Verstappen into second and, with his closest title rival and teammate Oscar Piastri in fifth, he can further extend his advantage at the top of the standings on Sunday. Indeed, he had been so cool in advance that he took in spot of shut-eye before it began and then weathered the hazardous conditions with insouciance. “To be honest, I was having a quick nap before qualifying and I was expecting it to be dry but I woke up and saw that it was raining,” he said. “I thought: ‘Oh crap, this isn’t going to go well.’” Yet he had...",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/22/formula-one-las-vegas-grand-prix-f1-qualifying-pole-lando-norris-oscar-piastri-report,22/11/2025
Miliband urges Cop30 to find ‘creative’ routes to roadmap on phasing out fossil fuel | Cop30 | The Guardian,"UK energy secretary says UN climate talks must find way to keep proposals alive despite significant resistance Supporters of a global phaseout of fossil fuels must find “creative” ways to keep the proposal alive, including making it voluntary rather than binding, the UK energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has said in the closing stages of the UN climate talks. As the Cop30 summit in Brazil carried on past the Friday night deadline, the prospect of countries agreeing on the need for a roadmap to a global “transition away from fossil fuels” looked increasingly dim. A first draft of the potential outcome text from the summit had contained the formulation, but in the updated draft text produced on Friday by the Brazilian presidency it had been excised.

A make-or-break budget: inside the Treasury before Labour’s crucial day | Budget 2025 | The Guardian,"From the outside, the run-up to Rachel Reeves’s announcement has looked chaotic, and many see the future of the chancellor and PM in the balance Every budget could be described, to a greater or lesser extent, as a high-stakes moment. Things can easily go badly wrong, as Gordon Brown discovered when he abolished the 10p tax rate in 2007, or George Osborne when his 2012 ‘omnishambles’ budget fell apart over pasties, and especially Kwasi Kwarteng, whose disastrous mini-budget of 2022 sent the Conservatives spiralling towards electoral defeat. Rachel Reeves appears to have come perilously close to the turmoil of previous budgets, and that’s before she has even delivered it. Veterans of the Blair government who have watched the chancellor at work behind the scenes say she has a calm, methodical approach, which compares favourably with the chaos that surrounded Brown in the buildup to his budgets, as KitKat wrappers and pages of speech drafts were strewn around the floor of No 11.

‘Superfluous consumerism’: adult Advent calendar trend alarms green groups | Christmas | The Guardian,"Trend is adding to ‘waste crisis’ owing to individual packaging and potential for unwanted items, campaigners say The trend for Advent calendars aimed at adults is “superfluous consumerism” that adds to excessive and wasteful consumption, according to environmental groups. While once children excitedly opened a door each day to see what festive picture lay behind it, adults can now count down the days to Christmas with calendars containing everything from luxury beauty products to instant mashed potato. This year’s adult versions include beauty calendars such as the Nivea Women’s one at about £30 and one from Liberty priced at £275. But some have raised concerns over the packaging involved in providing 24 products to either be unwrapped or revealed each day, and the potential for unwanted items.

I am a ragu-fancier and a kheema fanatic. Unlike with most foods, however, it doesn’t do to rationalise this love for ragu, because it is a mash of things chopped up so small that they all lose their texture. This might sound a bit woo-woo, but the joy of ragu comes from feeling your way through it, from the chopping and standing with your thoughts, to stirring a bubbling pot and the smell creeping under the door. A ragu isn’t just a ragu, it’s a coming-together of good things: thoughts, feelings, ingredients, time and effort. The greens of the spring onions will need a proper wash.

Two Australian police officers were killed in an ambush. It was deemed terrorism – but an inquest says otherwise | Australia news | The Guardian,"Six people died during the shootings at a remote property in Wieambilla, Queensland. A coroner says a family’s shared paranoid delusions drove their attack Three years ago on a remote Australian property, a trio of paranoid, deluded conspiracy theorists lay in wait. The three members of the Train family spent a year preparing ambush positions for a confrontation with Queensland police at their home in Wieambilla, 270km west of Brisbane, believing the battle marked the end of the world. They believed they needed “to defend themselves and their property from what they regarded was an evil advance on them”, a coronial inquest has now found. The state coroner, Terry Ryan, on Friday accepted evidence by a forensic psychiatrist that they were gripped by a “folie a trois” – a shared psychotic disorder based on the psychotic paranoia of Gareth Train.

Survivor of Chilean blizzard that killed Briton says staff told trekkers they could proceed | Chile | The Guardian,"Tom Player speaks out about incident in which Victoria Bond died along with two Mexicans and two Germans A survivor of the blizzard that killed a British woman and four others in Chilean Patagonia has said that tourists were concerned about adverse weather conditions ahead of the trek, but were told by staff it was “normal” and they could proceed. Tom Player, a London-based composer, told the Guardian that during the brutal blizzard about 30 volunteers worked together in an attempt to try to rescue hikers. Nine people went missing on Monday in the Torres del Paine reserve in Patagonia, a popular tourist destination, amid heavy snowfall and winds reaching up to 120mph (193km/h). Four were rescued from a remote area in the mountains, but it was confirmed on Tuesday that two Mexicans, two Germans and a British woman, Victoria Bond, 40, had died.

I was sitting cross-legged on the grey carpet, in 1977, when I finished reading whichever of Enid Blyton’s brilliant Secret Seven mysteries contains the mind-blowing (genuinely, for a six-year-old) twist that “Emma Lane” turns out to be a road and not a person. My favourite book growing up Up to the age of 12, Blyton’s Secret Seven and Five Find-Outers mysteries; from 12 onwards, it was Agatha Christie. Growing up, I was certain that no other kind of story could ever hope to be as satisfying as the very best mystery story.

"Ukraine banned from Nato, Russia readmitted to the G8 and territory ceded: what’s in Trump’s draft plan | Ukraine | The Guardian","Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he expects to discuss the plan – which was reportedly drafted by Russian and US officials – with Trump Donald Trump’s latest plan for ending the war in Ukraine would see territory ceded to Russia, Russia readmitted to the G8 and Ukraine banned from joining Nato, according to drafts of the proposal seen by Axios, AFP and the Associated Press. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he expected to discuss the plan with Trump “in coming days,” adding any deal must bring a “dignified peace” with “respect for our independence, our sovereignty.” The cautious response from Ukraine’s presidential administration stood in contrast to the outrage at the plan from some Ukrainian officials who called it “absurd” “capitulation” and the effective end of its existence as an independent country The plan appears to repeat Moscow’s maximalist demands and violate numerous Ukrainian red lines and would require an about-turn from Zelenskyy, who has said giving up territory...",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/21/trump-ukraine-peace-plan-zelenskyy-territory-ceded-nato-russia-g8,21/11/2025
‘The French people want to save us’: help pours in for glassmaker Duralex | France | The Guardian,"The brand, which evokes nostalgia and pride, hit its €5m fundraising target within hours and orders have soared Drop a Duralex glass and it will most likely bounce, not break. The French company itself has tumbled several times in the past two decades and always bounced back, but never quite as spectacularly as when, earlier this month, it asked the public for money. An appeal for €5m (£4.4m) of emergency funding to secure the immediate future of the glassworks took just five hours and 40 minutes to reach its target. Within 48 hours, the total amount pledged had topped €19m. François Marciano, 59, the director general of Duralex, said the response had astonished everyone at the company. “We thought it would take five or six weeks to raise the €5m. When it reached nearly €20m we had to say stop. Enough,” he said. As a staff cooperative, €5m is the maximum Duralex can accept in public investment under financial rules.

It is easy to forget that Sterling was the first of 50 signings under the club’s owners. He is a four-time Premier League champion who was England’s star player at Euro 2020 and could once be relied upon to score at least 10 goals a season. Today his role has been reduced to occupying a space in Chelsea’s so-called bomb squad, training away from the first team, on different pitches, at different times and with limited access to facilities. It is easy to sympathise with the Englishman; five managers have taken charge of Chelsea since his arrival and more than £500m has been spent on wingers – hardly the biggest vote of confidence.

Her dramatic announcement of her resignation on Friday was a typical act: out of the blue, full of punchy language and rage and – mostly – unexpected by people on both sides of the political aisle. She railed against the “political industrial complex” and said “not one elected leader like me is able to stop Washington’s machine from gradually destroying our country”.

It was impossible to measure the excitement in a seven-year-old from Norway making his first pilgrimage to Anfield. Inside was the promise of watching his favourite player, Daniel Sturridge, and the rest of a freewheeling side throwing everything at a title push. But as Sindre Walle Egeli and his family reached the turnstiles, the cruelest of realities dawned. “It’s not a good memory,” Walle Egeli says. “We showed up, ready to go, and it turned out we’d got fake tickets.

The Guardian view on authentic casting in Wicked: finally a true celebration of difference | Editorial | The Guardian,"The wider TV and film industries have a long way to go in including disabled actors and creators, and leaving stereotypes behind While the entertainment industry has been at pains to address issues of diversity in race, gender and sexuality, disability remains shockingly underrepresented. It’s not just that disabled actors are discounted for many roles. As actors and activists have pointed out, “blacking up” might have become taboo, but “cripping up” is still a shoo-in for awards. In almost 100 years, only three disabled actors have won an Oscar, compared to 25 able-bodied actors who have won for playing disabled characters. The arrival this weekend of Wicked: For Good, the second part of a prequel story to The Wizard of Oz, has put the importance of authentic casting in the spotlight once more. The story of green-skinned witch Elphaba, and the prejudice she faces, Wicked is a celebration of difference. Yet since the hit musical opened in 2003, only able-bodied actors had played the...",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/21/the-guardian-view-on-authentic-casting-in-wicked-finally-a-true-celebration-of-difference,21/11/2025

An inquest in 2018 concluded Wanjiru, a hairdresser and the mother of a five-month-old baby, was murdered by British soldiers after she was found half-naked in a septic tank at the Lions Court hotel two months after she disappeared.

Elgar: The Dream of Gerontius album review – Gardner and the LPO’s reading is bold and dramatic | Classical music | The Guardian,"(LPO)Recorded live at the BBC Proms, Edward Gardner and the London Philharmonic Orchestra’s propulsive performance, with soloists Allan Clayton, Jamie Barton and James Platt, is one to cherish The Dream of Gerontius may be the unlikely star of Alan Bennett’s The Choral, but it’s hardly in need of a popularity boost: Edward Gardner’s vibrant new recording is one of three released in the last two years, with another due in January. Recorded live at the 2022 BBC Proms, this propulsive reading has a great deal going for it. Allan Clayton captures the febrile nature of the dying man whose every sensation is both a terror and a fascination. His heroic tone thrills in the great prayer, Sanctus Fortis, while an expressive use of text illuminates the philosophical question and answer session in Part Two. Jamie Barton’s luxurious mezzo-soprano possesses a tangible immediacy as well as offering ample reserves of comfort. James Platt’s craggy bass is well-suited to the Angel of the Agony.

The extraordinary exchange was sparked after Democratic lawmakers with military or national security backgrounds – the Congressional representatives Maggie Goodlander, Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and the senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin – posted a video on Facebook addressed to US service members. “The administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence professionals against American citizens,” they said, and added: “You must refuse illegal orders.” Although they did not specify which orders might be illegal, Trump has come under fire for sending the US military into American cities for...",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/22/trump-military-veterans,22/11/2025

My Struggle had become a runaway success in Norway – a success that would subsequently be repeated across the world – but the project provoked anger in some quarters for its portrayal of friends and family members. This was a work of art that came at a price. Hence, for its creator, its Faustian aspect. That experience lies at the root of Knausgård’s latest novel, The School of Night, the fourth volume in his Morning Star sequence, in which his typical character studies and fine-grained attention to the minutiae of daily life are married to a compelling supernatural plot involving a mysterious star appearing in the sky and the dead returning to life.

Some of the Dutch club’s internationals were on holiday, seven of their starters from the final would leave that summer and Copenhagen were well ahead in preparations, but even so, the scoreline was bruising. It felt as if Slot had to start all over again. “I can remember it like yesterday,” says Marino Pusic, Slot’s assistant at Feyenoord and earlier at AZ. “The score could have been even higher – that says enough.” Copenhagen’s then coach, Jess Thorup, described it as more akin to “a training session than an actual friendly match”.

Indeed, the defection of Kruger, a heavy-weight on the Conservative right who served on the front bench and been tipped as a possible future leader, was seen as a major coup for Reform, catching commentators off-guard.

To me, as a person unfamiliar with Star Trek, he looked like he was wearing pyjamas. This was my first vision of him, but we didn’t talk at all that night.

Playing Andy, a young boy whose toys include cowboy Woody and spaceman Buzz Lightyear, his was the first voice ever heard in a feature-length Pixar animation. Toy Story was released 30 years ago on Saturday, but to Morris the memory of its premiere is as fresh as ever. “I still have goosebumps thinking about it because it started and then there’s Andy, and everyone turned to look at me and I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, here we go,’” the 41-year-old voice actor says by phone from San Francisco. “I couldn’t believe what we were watching because it was groundbreaking.

Abortion banned again in North Dakota after court reverses a judge’s earlier decision | PBS News,"Jack Dura, Associated Press Jack Dura, Associated Press BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Abortion is again illegal in North Dakota after the state’s Supreme Court on Friday couldn’t muster the required majority to uphold a judge’s ruling that struck down the state’s ban last year. The law makes it a felony crime for anyone to perform an abortion, though it specifically protects patients from prosecution. Doctors could be prosecuted and penalized by as much as five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. WATCH: Underground networks for abortion pills appear as states limit access Three justices agreed that the ban is unconstitutionally vague under the state constitution. The other two justices said the law is not unconstitutional. The state constitution requires at least four of the five justices to agree for a law to be found unconstitutional, a high bar.

Texas seeks Supreme Court order to use congressional map judges ruled likely racially biased | PBS News,"Mark Sherman, Associated Press Mark Sherman, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Texas on Friday asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order to be allowed to use a congressional redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump that is favorable to Republicans in the 2026 elections despite a lower court ruling that it likely discriminates on the basis of race. READ MORE: Federal judges block Texas congressional map drawn to help GOP in 2026 midterms The state is calling on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March.

BBQ gas is helping to cool a warming planet - The Business Times,"Propane, ammonia and carbon dioxide are rapidly displacing the hydrofluorocarbons in refrigerators and air-cons – and reducing greenhouse damage THERE are plenty of sophisticated materials that the world is counting on to limit global warming. Polysilicon for solar panels. Rare-earth magnets for wind turbines. Lithium for electric vehicle batteries. But propane? Believe it or not, the fossil hydrocarbon – produced from oil and gas wells, and mostly used as a cooking and heating fuel for barbecues, boilers and domestic stoves – may help turn the tide on some of the most damaging greenhouse gases humans have ever produced. Isobutane, another popular barbecue fuel, has a similar role to play, as do ammonia and even carbon dioxide. Decoding Asia newsletter: your guide to navigating Asia in a new global order.

"Economists raise 2025 Singapore growth forecasts on strong Q3, but stay cautious on 2026 - The Business Times","Still, most private-sector analysts upgrade estimates for next year, with some projections at the higher end of the official 1 to 3% range [SINGAPORE] Private-sector economists followed the Ministry of Trade and Industry’s (MTI) lead in raising their 2025 growth forecasts for Singapore, after better-than-expected third-quarter figures on Friday (Nov 21). Most also upgraded their estimates for 2026 – with some of these figures falling in the upper half of the newly released official forecast range of 1 to 3 per cent. The strong performance in 2025 partly reflects the front-loading of trade before the US tariffs kicked in, said MTI’s chief economist Yong Yik Wei. But in 2026, US tariffs will drag more on growth, as front-loading effects fade and the tariffs have “a full year’s worth” of impact.

Scaling AI sustainably: Four missteps leaders must avoid - The Business Times,"A greener digital future starts with smarter decisions across the C-suite and managerial levels ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) is scaling at breakneck speed across Asia – but the region’s infrastructure, energy systems and sustainability frameworks are struggling to keep up. In August 2025, Singapore introduced a new data centre standard to improve IT energy efficiency in tropical climates, targeting at least a 30 per cent reduction in energy use through smarter equipment selection and optimised operations. China is experimenting with underwater data centres to cut cooling costs, while markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia are tightening environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting rules.

"Thailand turns to Pop Mart, Miniso to win back Chinese tourists - The Business Times","ON A late October morning, a long queue snaked through Siam Square, the bustling heart of Bangkok’s shopping district. The crowd had gathered for the grand opening of the first overseas Miniso Land — a multistory superstore for trendy toys. The ground floor of the new Miniso flagship location was a shrine to Disney’s “Zootopia 2.” Local influencers in cosplay and media guests browsed aisles of co-branded merchandise, part of a global launch that the Chinese toy retailer chose to debut in Thailand. Just 500 metres away, rival trendy toy retailer Pop Mart’s two-story store teemed with local shoppers and Chinese tourists snapping up Labubu dolls and other collectibles already sold out in China. Pop Mart is still enlarging the space to make room for another of its hit piece of intellectual property (IP).

Tag Heuer CEO Antoine Pin steers brand into a new era - The Business Times,"Returning to the brand where he began his career three decades ago, he reflects on what keeps human connection at the heart of its legacy [SINGAPORE] When Antoine Pin stepped into the chief executive officer role at TAG Heuer last September, it marked his third tenure at the brand – and a deeply personal homecoming. The LVMH veteran began his watchmaking journey here in 1994. “When I finished school, I did my military service, and right after, I got into my car, crossed from France into Switzerland and started working for TAG Heuer,” he recalled. Pin, who previously helmed Bvlgari’s watch division, was in Singapore during the Grand Prix weekend, when he spoke with The Business Times. TAG Heuer hosted a meet-and-greet with Red Bull Racing driver Yuki Tsunoda at its Formula One-themed pop-up at ION Orchard.

US accuses four of smuggling advanced Nvidia chips to China - The Business Times,"The four charged in the indictment are Hon Ning Ho, Cham Li, Jin Chen and Brian Raymond [FLORIDA] Federal prosecutors charged two Chinese nationals and two US citizens with a scheme to ship millions of US dollars worth of sophisticated chips made by Nvidia to China in violation of national security export restrictions. The men used a fake real estate business in Tampa, Florida, as a front to move the shipments of hundreds of chips through Malaysia and ultimately to China without applying for export licenses from the US Commerce Department, according to an indictment unsealed on Wednesday (Nov 19). US laws curtailing China’s access to advanced semiconductors began in earnest three years ago, and have been kept in place over concern that artificial intelligence (AI) chips will strengthen China’s military and threaten US national security. China’s rapid advances, including the launch of the DeepSeek AI chatbot in January, have heightened US fears that its top economic rival is finding...",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/us-accuses-four-smuggling-advanced-nvidia-chips-china,22/11/2025
Nvidia’s AI supremacy is a weapon that cuts both ways - The Business Times,"While the chipmaker is the big winner from the booming technology, it is singularly exposed to changing expectations IT’S hard to overstate how unlikely it is that a business with almost US$200 billion of annual revenue would grow at a rate of over 60 per cent. Yet, such are the fantastical finances of Nvidia. The chipmaker that dominates artificial intelligence continued to break all the rules that apply to large companies with its quarterly earnings on Wednesday (Nov 19). Investors who try to predict how long this can persist do so at their peril. Nvidia is selling every piece of silicon it can make today, and piling up orders for those it plans to make tomorrow. Every indicator worth watching is therefore going up. The company breezed through analysts’ estimates of sales and profit in its latest quarter. Founder Jensen Huang had previously predicted US$500 billion of sales from Nvidia’s newer ranges of chips over 2025 and 2026; his finance chief now expects to beat that.

US job growth beats expectations in September; unemployment rate rises to 4.4% - The Business Times,"Nonfarm payrolls increased by 119,000 jobs after a downwardly revised 4,000 drop in August [WASHINGTON] US job growth accelerated in September, but the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 per cent and the economy shed jobs in the prior month, suggesting labour market conditions remained sluggish. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 119,000 jobs after a downwardly revised 4,000 drop in August, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Thursday (Nov 20). Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 50,000 jobs would be added after a previously reported 22,000 gain in August. The report was initially due on Oct 3, but was delayed by the 43-day shutdown of the government. The longest shutdown in history has forced the BLS to cancel the release of October’s report, as no data was collected for the household survey to calculate the unemployment rate for that month. October nonfarm payrolls will instead be combined with November’s employment report now due on December 16, the BLS...",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/us-job-growth-beats-expectations-september-unemployment-rate-rises-4-4,22/11/2025

New hires in AI could get up to 20% raise even as salary growth moderates: Robert Walters survey - The Business Times,"Companies are grappling with cost pressures while talent is demanding higher compensation [SINGAPORE] There is a growing mismatch in salary expectations between Singapore employers and jobseekers heading into 2026, as companies grapple with cost pressures while talent demands higher compensation to match inflation and skill scarcity. According to the Robert Walters Salary Survey 2026, while 27 per cent of employers are willing to offer pay rises above 10 per cent to new hires, 83 per cent of professionals changing jobs expect an increment surpassing that figure. Furthermore, nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of job movers are likely to request a salary jump of more than 20 per cent.

Nickel investors on edge as Indonesia tightens the screws on smelters - The Business Times,"New rules require applicants for refinery permits to stop producing intermediate nickel products [JAKARTA] Nickel-rich Indonesia’s industrial ambitions have run into rough currents again, as the government tightens rules on new smelter developments. The new regulation threatens to upend multibillion-dollar investments tied to the world’s largest nickel reserves and South-east Asia’s biggest economy. The stricter rules, aimed at pushing the sector deeper into downstream manufacturing, introduce a fresh layer of uncertainty for companies already navigating a weak price cycle, supply glut, and policy environment that analysts say is testing investor patience.

IMF’s Katz plans to visit China for Article IV talks - The Business Times,"[LONDON] The International Monetary Fund’s No 2 official Dan Katz will travel to China to join a mission conducting an annual review of the country’s economy, according to people familiar with the matter. He is expected to join policy discussions and meet government officials in Beijing, the people added, asking not to be identified because the information is not public. It would be Katz’s first trip to the country since he was appointed as deputy managing director of the IMF in early October. The consultation is expected to take place in early December, one of the people added. It’s not uncommon for the IMF’s top deputy to visit China during what are known as Article IV consultations.

Hands off the company’s data: How protecting such intellectual property becomes challenging - The Business Times,"With more cases of data theft from firms, do we need to have tougher legal options to protect proprietary information?

Zhang Changjie, a former employee of quantitative trading firm Genk Capital, copied almost 3,000 files and sent them to his own e-mail address in March 2018.

Japan tourism faces US$1.2 billion hit on China rift; Singapore sees new bookings rise - The Business Times,"Most Chinese airlines are waiving cancellation fees on tickets to Japan, accelerating cancellations [HONG KONG] Japan could lose out on as much as US$1.2 billion in visitor spending between now and the end of the year as would-be travellers from China cancel their trips due to a worsening diplomatic spat. Around 30 per cent of the 1.44 million trips to Japan from China planned to the end of December have been cancelled since Beijing advised citizens to avoid travelling to their Asian neighbour, according to figures from China Trading Desk. Roughly 70 per cent of the drop comes from near-term departures being cancelled or delayed, while new bookings have not materialised, according to the market researcher that specialises in travel data.

The secret BMW driving course that money can’t buy - The Business Times,"Select customers are invited to take up the BMW White Glove Experience.

I squint at it. It looks fine to me. But McCann, who trains chauffeurs for the world’s wealthiest families, spots what I can’t: a seatbelt is ever so slightly twisted. “That looks like someone’s already been in there,” he explains, untwisting it with a flick. Immediately, inexplicably, it looks much better. When a chauffeur prepares a car, it should look box fresh, he explains. Otherwise, it’s like entering your hotel suite for the first time and seeing a handprint on the pillow.

"COP30: Singapore, Malawi sign preliminary carbon credits deal - The Business Times","MOU paves way for trading of carbon credits aligned with Article 6 of Paris Agreement [SINGAPORE] Singapore and Malawi have inked a preliminary carbon credits deal on the sidelines of the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) currently taking place in Belem, Brazil. The memorandum of understanding (MOU), signed on Thursday (Nov 20) at the Singapore Pavilion at COP30, will pave the way for both countries to trade carbon credits aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. These credits come with corresponding adjustments – which mean that the emissions being offset are counted only once by the country that buys the credits, while the country that produces them gives up the right to use the credits to meet its own national climate targets. This is to avoid the double counting of underlying emissions reductions or removals when carbon credits are traded.

Exxon freezes plans for major hydrogen plant amid weak customer demand - The Business Times,"[HOUSTON] Exxon Mobil has paused plans to build what would be one of the world’s largest hydrogen production facilities due to weak customer demand, CEO Darren Woods told Reuters in an interview on Friday (Nov 21). The suspension of the project, which had already experienced delays, reflects a wider slowdown in efforts by traditional oil and gas firms to transition to cleaner energy sources as many of the initiatives struggle to turn a profit. US President Donald Trump had also yanked funding for green initiatives to focus on fossil fuels. Oil major Exxon announced plans in 2022 to build the plant at its refining and chemical complex in Baytown, Texas, with a goal of producing one billion cubic feet per day of so-called blue hydrogen, a clean fuel that produces water when burned. Potential customers have stayed on the sidelines due to the higher cost of using hydrogen, Woods said, adding that an industrial slowdown and economic uncertainty in Europe have further crimped demand....",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/exxon-freezes-plans-major-hydrogen-plant-amid-weak-customer-demand,22/11/2025

It is unmistakably a Kaws creation – a colossal, reclining Companion “mega-toy” that has, for days, dominated both the skyline and the Instagram feeds of anyone living within a 20-kilometre radius. And yet, it isn’t even the most surreal sight in Abu Dhabi right now. Across the emirate, 22 monumental light artworks have transformed mangroves, forts, markets, islands and desert oases into shimmering, nocturnal dreamscapes. Together, they make up Manar Abu Dhabi – a vast outdoor wonderland of light and land art that has, since Nov 15, quietly become one of the region’s most striking cultural statements.

Travel ban on Victor Hartono casts spotlight on Indonesia’s richest family: Analysts - The Business Times,"The chief executive of Indonesia’s Djarum and the eldest son of billionaire Robert Budi Hartono is barred from leaving the country [SINGAPORE] The Indonesian authorities’ decision to impose an overseas travel ban on a member of the country’s richest family in connection with a tax-related corruption probe has cast the spotlight on that family as well as the relationship between Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and his predecessor Joko Widodo, said analysts. Victor Hartono – the chief executive of Indonesian conglomerate Djarum and the eldest son of billionaire Robert Budi Hartono – has been barred from leaving the country as part of an ongoing investigation into an alleged graft scheme involving attempts to reduce tax liabilities.

"Forget Musk’s latest pay package, his last one could wipe out years of Tesla profits - The Business Times","Tesla faces potential US$26 billion profit hit if it loses its appeal over Musk’s pay ruling [LOS ANGELES] Tesla’s gaudy US$1 trillion executive-compensation package for CEO Elon Musk has obscured a more pressing concern: Musk’s 2018 pay package – still tied up in court – could eat up years’ worth of the electric vehicle maker’s future profits. The Delaware Supreme Court will soon decide whether to reverse a lower-court ruling invalidating Musk’s previous record-breaking compensation package. If Tesla’s appeal fails, it could trigger a US$26 billion hit to profits over two years to account for the replacement stock-compensation package it has promised Musk – at today’s much higher stock price. For comparison, US$26 billion would equal more than half of Tesla’s total net income since becoming profitable in 2019.

Bitcoin drop hits market makers in fragile trading landscape - The Business Times,"[NEW YORK] Bitcoin is crashing into dangerous territory – and options-fuelled selling is adding to the volatility. The largest cryptocurrency dropped as much as 7.6 per cent on Friday (Nov 21) to US$80,553, deepening a sell-off that’s erased nearly 25 per cent of its value this month. November is now shaping up to be Bitcoin’s worst month since the 2022 collapse of Terra and FTX – a stretch that triggered a cascade of corporate failures across the industry. This latest slump has been driven primarily by spot selling – including redemptions from large exchange-traded funds (ETFs), long-dormant wallets offloading holdings, and fading demand from momentum traders. But options positioning has contributed to the turbulence, magnifying price swings as Bitcoin breaches levels where dealers adjust hedges to stay neutral – a process known as gamma exposure. “Bitcoin remains vulnerable to continued technical pressure with the potential for a gamma-driven acceleration through key support...",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/crypto-alternative-assets/bitcoin-drop-hits-market-makers-fragile-trading-landscape,22/11/2025
"Luxury goods market to return to growth in 2026, Bain predicts - The Business Times","It’s likely to grow between 3% and 5% next year at constant exchange rates [NEW YORK] The market for personal luxury goods should return to growth in 2026 after two years of flatlining, according to one of the world’s biggest consulting firms. Sales of high-end goods, including jewellery, leather handbags, shoes and ready-to-wear fashions, will probably grow between 3 per cent and 5 per cent next year at constant exchange rates, Bain & Co estimates in its outlook on the state of luxury demand. Bain currently expects the market will remain roughly flat this year, as it did in 2024, partner Claudia d’Arpizio told Bloomberg in an interview. The consulting group initially saw luxury demand shrinking by as much as 5 per cent this year when it issued its June report.

Ever since its original chef, Kazuhiro Hamamoto, left to go solo in 2021, naysayers have been waiting to read Ki-Sho’s obituary. One day you hear about the next acclaimed chef stepping in. The next – he’s gone. And then another. Then he’s gone too. You’d think Ki-Sho installed a revolving door with extra-slippery handles, or maybe it’s just been waiting for the right chef to come along. That one could be Taro Takayama – and we have to say, we hope he sticks.

Judge in Google ad tech case seeks quick fix for web giant's monopolies - The Business Times,"[ALEXANDRIA] The US judge considering whether to order a breakup of Google’s advertising technology business asked the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday (Nov 21) how quickly such a remedy would take effect, saying, “time is of the essence”. Google has so far come away largely unscathed from a bipartisan government legal crackdown on the dominance of Big Tech - a push that began during the first term of US President Donald Trump. But that could change, depending on what US District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, decides in the DOJ’s case over Google’s ad tech. At closing arguments in the case on Friday, the judge brought up the fact that Google will seek to appeal the case, a move that would likely push any forced sale years down the road. “The kind of request you are making most likely would not be as easily enforceable while an appeal is pending,” the judge said. Brinkema ruled in April that Google holds two illegal ad tech monopolies, and is now considering...",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/judge-google-ad-tech-case-seeks-quick-fix-web-giants-monopolies,22/11/2025
UK to levy US$655 million of new tariffs on low-value imports - The Business Times,"[LONDON] Britain’s finance ministry said on Friday (Nov 21) that finance minister Rachel Reeves plans to raise around £500 million (US$655 million or S$856 million) a year by removing an exemption from tariffs for imports of individual goods costing under £135. Reeves has pledged not to increase the cost of living for British households in her annual budget on Nov 26, but retailers such as clothing chain Next and rival Primark-owner Associated British Foods (ABF) have lobbied against what they see as unfair competition from overseas stores. While major retailers must pay tariffs on many goods they import in bulk, Britons who buy similar items direct from online retailers, often based in China, do not have to pay tariffs if they cost below a certain amount. “It’s time to make sure our local shops can compete fairly with overseas sellers and keep driving growth and good jobs across the UK,” Reeves said in a statement.

"Planning for senior living needs rethink on regulations, costs and stigma: property players - The Business Times","Seniors want autonomy and social support, panellists say [SINGAPORE] As Singapore’s ageing population continues to grow, the conversation around assisted-living developments has become more relevant than ever, but the industry has many issues to tackle. “From urban planning, design and developments, to manpower, culture and business models, they are all pieces of a puzzle that we need to fit together,” said Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore (Redas) president Tan Swee Yiow. He was speaking at the inaugural Redas-Ageing Asia Dialogue on Thursday (Nov 20). By 2030, more than 900,000 Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above. “This demographic shift requires us to rethink how we design our homes, communities and services,” said Tan. “We need to explore questions like, should we consider a separate zoning category for senior living, to facilitate development?

BofA Tower gets Chicago’s biggest mortgage bond deal since Covid - The Business Times,"[NEW YORK] A mortgage loan for Chicago’s Bank of America (BOA) Tower is being refinanced with US$700 million in bonds, a rare bright spot for the city’s beaten-down real estate market, according to people familiar with the matter. The refinancing signals bond investors still have appetite for deals involving higher quality buildings with more amenities. The mortgage bonds’ sale is the largest of its kind in Chicago since the pandemic, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private negotiations. The Chicago office market has been a sore spot for investors after Covid-19 hollowed out the downtown. Demand for offices in cities like New York has started to rebound, but Chicago is still struggling with empty towers.

"War on scams: Record crypto seizures, explosive raids, but political theatre gets in the way - The Business Times","The fallout from the Prince Group investigation has continued to reverberate [BANGKOK] It is a sobering thought: The sheer scale, staying power and callous profitability of the global “pig-butchering” scam syndicates – headquartered in South-east Asia and built on modern-day slave labour – are such that even the largest-ever criminal asset forfeiture could barely make a dent. The US Department of Justice’s seizure of around US$15 billion (S$19.6 billion) worth of Bitcoin was arguably the most eye-catching component of a landmark convergence of criminal charges, sanctions and regulatory measures announced on Oct 14. It was directed at Cambodian conglomerate Prince Group and its Chinese-born chairman Chen Zhi, accused by US prosecutors of masterminding a “sprawling cyberfraud empire” and industrial-scale money laundering.

Oil prices settle down at lowest in a month as US seeks Russia-Ukraine peace deal - The Business Times,"[NEW YORK] Oil prices eased about 1 per cent on Friday (Nov 21) to settle at one-month lows as the US pushed for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal that could boost global oil supplies, while uncertainty over US interest rates curbed investors’ risk appetite.

Both crude benchmarks were down about 3 per cent for the week and at their lowest settlements since Oct 21. Market sentiment turned bearish as Washington pushed for a peace plan between Ukraine and Russia to end the three-year war, while sanctions on Russian oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil were set to take effect on Friday.

Speaking in parliament on Friday (Nov 21), Ueda also said the BOJ must be mindful that the weak yen could affect underlying inflation, a key gauge it looks at in deciding how soon to raise rates, by pushing up import costs and broader prices. “Compared with the past, the impact of currency moves on inflation may have become bigger because companies have become more active in raising prices and wages,” Ueda said....",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/bank-japan-drops-fresh-hints-near-term-rate-hike-yen-slides,22/11/2025

Do you really need to 'refuel' during exercise? What to know about mid-workout energy gels and sports drinks - CNA Lifestyle,"Sports nutritionists say mid-workout fuelling is essential only during intense efforts over 90 minutes. For shorter durations, simple pre-workout snacks are usually sufficient. (Photo: The New York Times) Sunny Blende, a sports nutritionist, once described ultramarathons as “eating and drinking contests, with a little exercise and scenery thrown in.” Marathons, too, have come to resemble mobile buffets, with fueling stations almost every mile. And top cyclists and triathletes are now scarfing down more sugary drinks and gels than ever in search of a performance edge. It’s enough to make some casual athletes wonder whether they should pack some calories every time they lace up their trainers or head to the gym. This growing focus on mid-exercise refuelling is based in part on research showing that elite athletes can digest calories more rapidly than previously thought. But whether the rest of us should emulate this approach is less clear, according to running coach and sports...",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/workout-fueling-energy-gels-5468516,22/11/2025

"Built from sweat, stalled by succession: What happens when Singapore's SMEs have no one to take over the helm - CNA","Many SME founders built their businesses through sheer grit and long hours, but few have planned for what happens next.

"Inside Singapore’s education ‘arms race’: Stress, inequality and the push for change - Yahoo News Singapore","SINGAPORE - It felt like the start of a high-stakes contest for Mr Harry Lee when his son Gabriel entered Primary 1 in 2022. Gabriel was an SG50 baby, referring to those born in 2015 when Singapore celebrated its 50th year of independence. More than 37,000 babies were born that year – the highest number recorded between 2015 and 2024 – possibly resulting in greater competition for school places. The registration process has several stages, with the earlier ones reserved for children with siblings in the school or parents who are alumni. These were not options for Gabriel. So Mr Lee aimed for Phase 2B, which gives priority to children whose parents have volunteered at the school. They were hoping to enter a popular school in Hougang where the family lives because of its academic reputation and emphasis on values. “Every day that we were on traffic warden duty counted as 45 minutes to these 40 hours, and we went once a week for 40 weeks,” said Mr Lee, who clocked his time mostly in the...",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/inside-singapore-education-arms-race-210000351.html,21/11/2025

6 'Invisible' Household Tasks That Drain Moms' Time And Energy,"Keeping a household running smoothly takes a lot of effort. There are the more obvious physical tasks like cooking meals, taking out the garbage, folding laundry and picking the kids up from school. But it also requires a whole bunch of behind-the-scenes planning, organizing, anticipating of needs, decision-making and delegating known as the mental load — an invisible kind of work. In heterosexual relationships, most of these invisible tasks tend to fall on the mom’s shoulders, even when both partners work outside of the home. Men today may be taking on more hands-on domestic responsibilities than they have in the past, but women are still usually carrying the bulk of the mental load.

Russia’s drone revolution heaps pressure on Ukrainian defenses - Yahoo News Singapore,"A top-secret Russian unit based in Moscow has changed the landscape of drone warfare, turning what was an advantage for the Ukrainians into a vulnerability.

Belousov visited its headquarters in October 2024 and was shown a range of drones being developed, according to video published by official Russian media. The advent of Rubicon – full name the Rubicon Center for Advanced Unmanned Technologies – is a prime example of how the Russian military has learnt to shrug off its rigid way of warfare during the Ukraine conflict and adapt to a rapidly evolving battlefield. Ukraine had already established a separate branch within its military – the Unmanned Systems Forces – in mid-2024.

Trump Says It's Totally Fine For Mamdani To Call Him A Fascist: 'That's OK' - Yahoo News Singapore,"Although President Donald Trumphyped up his meeting Friday with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, nothing prepared social media for the exchange between the two of them. And while everyone knew there was a good chance of at least one viral moment, no one expected it would come when Trump told Mamdani it was “OK” for the democratic socialist to call him a fascist.

Supreme Court pauses lower court order that blocked Texas’ new congressional maps - Yahoo News Singapore,"Texas urged the Supreme Court on Friday to boost President Donald Trump’s effort to help Republicans maintain control of Congress, asking the justices to review a federal court ruling that found the state’s new map is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Soon after the appeal was filed, Justice Samuel Alito temporarily blocked the lower court ruling that barred Texas from using the congressional maps, putting the fast-moving appeal on pause while the Supreme Court considers the case. The state’s emergency appeal could have enormous consequences for next year’s midterm elections, which will determine control of the House for the final two years of Trump’s presidency. A Democratic majority would likely unleash a string of investigations aimed at the administration and possibly block most of the president’s legislative agenda.

A patriot is an American that serves the United States of America, and Americans like the women standing behind me,” Greene said Tuesday.

BBC Board Member Resigns Amid Fallout From Broadcaster Editing Trump Speech - Yahoo News Singapore,"A BBC board member is the latest to resign from the broadcaster amid the backlash to a documentary that President Donald Trump plans to sue over. Shumeet Banerji, a tech investor who’s served as a non-executive board member since 2022, cited “governance issues” and noted he was “not consulted” about the events that led to two top news executives resigning, the BBC shared Friday. Politics: Senate Democrat Says Threats Exploded After Trump's Shocking Posts Banerji did not immediately respond to requests for comment on his decision. On its website, the BBC described him as being “responsible for upholding and protecting the independence of the BBC by acting in the public interest and exercising independent judgement.” His departure comes a week after Trump said he would likely sue the BBC for up to $5 billion after the news organization apologized for the way it edited a Trump speech that appeared in a documentary that aired a week before the 2024 presidential election.

Zelensky says US plan means Ukraine loses 'dignity' - or an ally - Yahoo News Singapore,"President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday pushed back against a US plan to end the war in Ukraine, while Russian leader Vladimir Putin welcomed the proposal that includes many of his hardline demands. With President Donald Trump giving Ukraine less than a week to sign, Zelensky pledged to work to ensure any deal would not ""betray"" Ukraine's interests, while acknowledging he risked losing Washington as an ally. Putin said the blueprint could ""lay the foundation"" for a final peace settlement, but threatened more land seizures if Ukraine walked away from negotiations. Ukraine faces one of the most challenging moments in its history, Zelensky said in an address to the nation, adding that he would propose alternatives to Trump's 28-point plan. Kyiv and its European allies were startled by the proposal -- which would force Ukraine to give up land, cut its army and pledge never to join NATO.

"Days ahead of terrorism designation for Maduro, US military performs large ‘attack demo’ near Venezuela - Yahoo News Singapore","The US military conducted its largest show of force to date near Venezuela on Thursday, ahead of a key Monday deadline that will see the US designate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization. The designation of “Cartel de los Soles,” a phrase that experts say is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group, as a foreign terrorist organization will authorize President Donald Trump to impose fresh sanctions. It doesn’t, however, explicitly authorize the use of lethal force, according to legal experts. Still, administration officials have been making the case that the terrorist designation will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela. “It gives more tools to our department to give options to the President,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Thursday. While the US has been accumulating military assets in the region, Trump has suggested he...",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/news/articles/days-ahead-terrorism-designation-maduro-213613558.html,22/11/2025
"Crowds, longer travel times expected during Nov 29-Dec 8 closure of Simei, Tanah Merah MRT stations - Yahoo News Singapore","SINGAPORE – Those who travel regularly on the East-West Line (EWL) are advised to factor in crowds and added journey time with the upcoming closure of Simei and Tanah Merah MRT stations. In a reminder on Nov 22, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said the closures from Nov 29 to Dec 8 mean there will be no train service between Bedok and Tampines stations, and between Tanah Merah and Expo stations. Affected MRT stations and bus stops are expected to be crowded, and journey times may take up to an additional 30 minutes. LTA had in October said that the move is to allow works to connect the tracks from the existing EWL to the East Coast Integrated Depot and to connect a new platform at Tanah Merah station. An estimated 180,000 passengers could be affected daily over the 10 days of service adjustments, LTA said then.

Trump didn’t want to get into any of that on Friday.

Residents in Kovan estate upset after private owner seals off back-lane shortcut - Yahoo News Singapore,"SINGAPORE - A back-lane shortcut in Robey Crescent has been sealed off with a metal gate, forcing residents who have used it for more than a decade to use a longer route along a canal to reach the main road. The narrow concrete strip measuring about 25m long runs behind a row of terraced houses between Robey Crescent and Jalan Arif, linking the private estate in Kovan to a bus stop in Hougang Avenue 2 and amenities located at the HDB blocks opposite. The path is a popular route used by grandparents walking their grandchildren to school, residents heading to work and domestic helpers going to the nearby supermarket. Residents first noticed the gate with a notice that said “private property” on Oct 28. Wire mesh was also put up at the other end of the lane. A land-title search showed that the strip belongs to Island Chartered, a real estate developer. One resident, who wanted to be known only as May, said: “My children were still able to access the lane when they went to school that...",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/residents-kovan-estate-upset-private-103723422.html,21/11/2025

An electrical fire on a lower deck of the cargo ship One Henry Hudson started at 6:38 p.m. local time, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. An explosion shook the vessel shortly before 8 p.m., knocking out power to lights and cranes, LAFD said. No injuries were reported, authorities said. The Port of Los Angeles said on a press release that four of its seven container terminals have suspended operations. “Over 128 firefighters have been dispatched, and that number is still growing.

"Judges block Trump from cutting hundreds of millions in grants to cities, counties - Yahoo News Singapore","A pair of federal judges on Friday separately blocked President Donald Trump’s administration from unilaterally imposing new conditions on hundreds of millions in US Department of Homeland Security grants to cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. US District Judge William Orrick in San Jose temporarily blocked the administration from unilaterally imposing new conditions on over $350 million in DHS grants to more than two dozen cities and counties in California, Washington and Arizona. In Chicago, US District Judge Manish Shah also entered an order temporarily blocking the new conditions on more than $100 million in DHS grants to New York, Boston and several other cities.

Zelensky warns of ‘difficult moment in history’ after Trump gives Ukraine days to accept his plan to end war - Yahoo News Singapore,"US President Donald Trump has given Ukraine less than a week to accept his plan – widely seen as favoring Russia – to end the war, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country faced “one of the most difficult moments” in its history. “I’ve had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines. But Thursday is it,” the US president said in a radio interview with Fox News. The 28-point plan put forward by Trump puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war, all long-standing Kremlin demands. It was characterized by Zelensky during a video address to the nation on Friday as presenting Ukraine with a choice between losing its dignity or a key ally. Speaking from the Oval Office later in the day, Trump said he was confident the plan was a “way of getting peace” but said it still needed Zelensky’s approval.

4 takeaways from the bizarrely chummy Trump-Mamdani meeting - Yahoo News Singapore,"President Donald Trump’s Oval Office meetings have become appointment viewing in his second term. But few have generated as much anticipation as when he welcomed New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Friday afternoon. Plenty were expecting a clash between the president and the young, up-and-coming democratic socialist politician whom Republicans have made clear they would very much like to turn into their 2026 boogeyman. What we got was decidedly not that. Below are some takeaways from the bizarrely chummy event. Okay, some people predicted that a version of this might happen. But it was still remarkable – especially coming from Trump. Reporters kept peppering the two men with questions pointing to their differences and the awful things they’d said about one another. But the two kept batting away the chance to throw down, emphasizing their common ground. Among Trump’s comments: “I think he’s going to surprise some conservative people, actually.” “Some of his ideas really are the...",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/news/articles/4-takeaways-bizarrely-chummy-trump-231032159.html,22/11/2025
Text messages and a moved SUV: How the government’s case against a Chicago woman shot by a Border Patrol agent fell apart - Yahoo News Singapore,"Even with a federal indictment hanging over her, claiming she had been a threat to law enforcement, Marimar Martinez was confident she could eventually prove her innocence. “I know the truth,” Martinez told CNN Friday in an exclusive interview. “I know what really happened that day.” After an extraordinary reversal by federal prosecutors in one of the most high-profile cases connected to Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, a judge dismissed charges Thursday against Martinez, a United States citizen who was accused of ramming the vehicle of a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago before he shot her several times. The ruling from US District Judge Georgia Alexakis came after she repeatedly raised concerns about the handling of the investigation, including the revelation the vehicle of the Border Patrol agent who shot Martinez was moved 1,000 miles away after the incident and text messages showing the agent apparently bragging about the shooting.

Body Language Experts Say Marjorie Taylor Greene’s CNN Apology For 'Toxic Politics' Reveals More Than She Intended - Yahoo News Singapore,"Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was once President Donald Trump’s loyal ally, but in a new CNN interview, she broke rank with Trump and apologized for her own “toxic” actions, taking a softened, contrite tone that is a striking difference from her firebrand politics. Amid Greene and Trump’s growing rift ahead of key 2026 midterm elections, Trump has withdrawn his support for Greene, calling her “wacky,” a “ranting Lunatic” and a “traitor” to the party in recent social media posts. Life: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice During the interview on CNN’s “State of The Union” with Dana Bash last Sunday, Greene said Trump calling her a traitor “is so extremely wrong.” “Those were the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” Greene said.

James Comey asks for his indictment be dismissed over Lindsey Halligan’s grand jury revelation - Yahoo News Singapore,"Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey are asking a federal judge to dismiss the charges against him because, they say, a grand jury never approved the final indictment in the case. The motion to dismiss comes after prosecutors, including interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, said in court this week that the indictment — which omitted a count that the grand jury rejected — was not seen in its final form by all grand jurors. “The grand jury voted to reject the only indictment that the government presented to it,” Comey’s attorneys wrote in Friday’s filing. “Instead of presenting the grand jury with a revised indictment, Ms. Halligan signed a new two count indictment that the grand jury had never seen or voted on.” Comey’s team is asking the judge to toss the case by as soon as Monday because of the “flagrant nature of the government’s misconduct during the grand jury process.” “Because at least 12 jurors did not ‘approve the actual indictment,’ there is no valid indictment of...",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/news/articles/james-comey-asks-indictment-dismissed-224414732.html,21/11/2025
Brazil’s ex-president Bolsonaro arrested at his home by federal police - Yahoo News Singapore,"Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was detained on Saturday at his residence in Brazil’s capital days before he was due to begin a prison sentence for leading a coup attempt, according to CNN affiliate CNN Brasil. In a statement, Federal Police said it executed a preventive arrest warrant that had been requested by the police themselves and authorized by the Supreme Court, CNN Brasil reported. He was arrested at his home in Brasília. Sources told CNN Brasil that a vigil organized by Bolsonaro’s oldest son, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, in front of the complex of residential buildings where the former president lives triggered the request for preventive detention. Bolsonaro was sentenced earlier this year to 27 years in prison for plotting to remain in power after losing the 2022 election to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and has been under house arrest.

Federal judge blocks IRS from sharing information to help ICE with deportations - Yahoo News Singapore,"A federal judge on Friday blocked the IRS from giving ICE the home addresses of taxpayers who might be undocumented immigrants — dealing a blow to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. The ruling is a significant victory for immigrant-rights group and liberal activists who are trying to resist the mass deportations that President Donald Trump has made a top priority for the first year of his second term. The Trump administration can appeal the decision, and it has a decent track record this year of overturning lower-court losses. A separate federal judge in a related case previously declined to block the data-sharing deal between Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Court records indicate that the IRS has provided ICE with information about 47,000 potentially undocumented taxpayers so far as part of the controversial data-sharing deal, a fraction of what the Trump administration requested.

"Trump and Mamdani bond over affordability issues, love of New York and winning in collegial Oval Office meeting - Yahoo News Singapore","New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was pressed Friday on whether he believes President Donald Trump is a fascist. Standing beside his host in the Oval Office, Mamdani began to answer – until the president, seated, interrupted. “That’s OK – you can just say yes. That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining,” Trump told his guest, laughing it off as he playfully tapped Mamdani on the arm. That collegial interaction was nearly unthinkable in the lead-up to the meeting as both sides postured, but the leader of the MAGA movement and the self-described democratic socialist made clear their conversation was a productive one – friendly, even. “The better he does, the happier I am,” Trump said of the mayor-elect, later expressing openness to living in Mamdani’s New York City. During the mayoral campaign, the president urged voters in his native city to back Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, over the GOP nominee, because he’d have a better shot at defeating...",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-mamdani-bond-over-affordability-234733302.html,21/11/2025
Bangladesh plans to execute its former leader. There’s one big thing in the way: India - Yahoo News Singapore,"She was once cast as a secular heroine, the daughter of a revolutionary leader, whose brutal assassination in the 1970s defined her political ascent. But Sheikh Hasina’s rise to the top of Bangladesh’s politics preceded a stunning fall from power to self-exile in India. A death sentence delivered in absentia could now see her executed – if New Delhi decides to send her back. The ousted leader was found guilty of crimes against humanity for the violent suppression of student protests that toppled her regime in 2024. She fled to India last August after 15 years of increasingly authoritarian rule, seeking refuge in the capital of one of her closest allies. Now she’s become a pawn in a tense standoff between the two countries as Dhaka demands her extradition to face justice for crimes that she insists she did not commit. “She had to flee the country to flee the rage of the people,” said Bangladeshi political scientist Mubashar Hasan. “Hiding in India and handed down a death penalty.

Bolivia says US drug agency to return to aid cocaine battle - Yahoo News Singapore,"Bolivia's brand-new narcotics czar, Ernesto Justiniano, told AFP Friday the US Drug Enforcement Administration, expelled in 2008, will be returning to bolster the South American country's anti-cocaine campaigns. Justiniano is part of the new administration of President Rodrigo Paz, a pro-business conservative who took office on November 8 after two decades of leftist rule. Paz, 58, is aiming for a sharp political, economic, social and diplomatic shift away from the policies of leftist leaders blamed by many for Bolivia's economic collapse, with dollars in short supply and annual inflation over 20 percent. In an interview with AFP Friday, Justiniano said ""there is a political commitment"" for the DEA to return to Bolivia, where he said cocaine production has spiraled out of control.

Manchester United and Liverpool in £100m transfer fight over breakout England star - Yahoo News Singapore,"Manchester United and Liverpool look to be on a transfer collision course over England star Elliot Anderson. The 23-year-old midfielder has established a reputation as one of the best midfielders in the country during an impressive rise to prominence, despite Nottingham Forest’s struggles in the Premier League this season. As well as shining at club level, Anderson has quickly become a favourite of England manager Thomas Tuchel, becoming a regular starter in midfield alongside Arsenal’s Declan Rice during World Cup qualifying. His sparkling form has not gone unnoticed by Forest’s Premier League rivals, with The Times reporting that Manchester United are tracking Anderson and view him as a potential replacement for Casemiro, whose current contract at Old Trafford - which includes an option for the club to trigger an automatic 12-month extension - is set to expire at the end of the current season.

Inside Mai Pham’s Re-Created Childhood Bedroom: From YouTube Dreams To Family Healing,"MaiPhamhas meticulously re-created her childhood bedroom in her New York apartment — perhaps as a vehicle for periodic escapism, since she doesn’t sleep in it. A “Don’t Bug Me” Miley Cyrus poster hangs on the door, teen heartthrobs plaster the walls, and Littlest Pet Shop figurines — the same ones she unboxed in her first YouTube video at age 7 — keep watch. The YouTuber’s vision board, complete with a mock-up of 2 million subscribers, hints at dreams she once longed to manifest. Today, she has more than 3 million. The pink room brims with fragments of her adolescence, a playful archive of the girl she used to be. But the room I’m standing in as I interview her is not just a replica of her childhood bedroom. It is a carefully constructed set where the 22-year-old records her podcast, “MaiSpace.” Each detail is a testament to the child she once was and the room she wished she’d had.

'She's Full Of S**t!': Kathy Hochul Trashes Elise Stefanik For Leaning Into Mamdani Attacks - Yahoo News Singapore,"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) didn’t mince her words toward Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) on Friday after the MAGA Republican continued her spree of Islamophobic attacks against New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Stefanik — who is running for governor and looks to challenge Hochul as she seeks a second full term next year — seemingly distanced herself from Donald Trump after the president praised Mamdani in their Oval Office meeting, one where Trump dismissed Stefanik’s “jihadist” label for the mayor-elect.

House Oversight Committee widens its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein - Yahoo News Singapore,"The House Oversight Committee is expanding its investigation into convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and searching for new targets — guaranteeing that the Epstein controversy is unlikely to die down even after the Justice Department was compelled by Congress to release the files that it has in its possession. This week, the investigative panel run by Republican Rep. James Comer issued subpoenas to two banks, called for a slew of documents from the US Virgin Islands attorney general and solicited advice from Epstein survivors about what the committee should next target. The panel has so far released tens of thousands of documents, emails and communications that it received from the Epstein estate that continue to open new lines of investigative inquiry.

Threats Pour In To Indiana GOP Lawmakers After They Dropped Redistricting Bid - Yahoo News Singapore,"Several GOP lawmakers in Indiana have received threats after they canceled a special session to redraw congressional maps at the behest of President Donald Trump.

Mike Braun said he and his family are among the Republicans targeted in a wave of threats against state officeholders this week as President Donald Trump pressures Hoosier State lawmakers to redraw the state’s congressional maps.

"Wingtech appeals Dutch decision over Nexperia ownership, documents show","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Chinese semiconductor company Wingtech has appealed to the Dutch government to rescind its decision to ​take control of its Netherlands-based computer chip subsidiary Nexperia,‌ documents seen by Reuters show. Wingtech first challenged the decision on October 21 and broadened ‌its complaints on November 10, the documents showed. In the appeal, lawyers for Wingtech urged the Ministry of Economic Affairs to revoke the order, which they said was an unprecedented and disproportionate ""deprivation of property""⁠ that lacked a ‌legal basis. The Dutch government suspended its intervention at Nexperia on Wednesday, after what it said were constructive talks ‍with China over a dispute which has led to shortages of chips needed by car manufacturers. But it did not revoke the September 30 decision, a move ​it said had been necessary to prevent the company's former ‌CEO from moving European operations to China from its current base in the Netherlands.

Armed bandits kidnap more than 300 students from Catholic school in Nigeria - Yahoo News Singapore,"Armed bandits kidnapped more than 300 students at a private Catholic school in Nigeria’s north-central Niger State, authorities say, the latest in a spate of mass abductions and attacks that have drawn the attention of the Trump administration. Despite some students managing to get to safety during Friday’s attack, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said 303 students and 12 teachers were abducted in the raid, updating an earlier figure of 215 students. Some are as young as ten. The figure was updated after a final census was carried out, according to CAN’s Niger State chapter chairman Most. Rev. Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, who visited St. Mary’s School on Friday to meet with the parents of the abducted children. Yohanna said the additional 88 students “were also captured after they tried to escape” during the attack, adding that the students were both male and female and aged between ten to 18 years old, Yohanna’s spokesman Daniel Atori told CNN on Saturday.

UN climate talks deadlocked as EU pushes fossil-fuel phaseout - Yahoo News Singapore,"The UN's COP30 climate talks spilled into overtime on Saturday, with the European Union in a standoff with oil producers and emerging countries over its push for a renewed commitment to a fossil-fuel phaseout. A closing plenary was scheduled for 1300 GMT in the Brazilian Amazon city of Belem, even as nations remained deadlocked after two weeks of negotiations that were supposed to end on Friday. The EU warned that the summit could finish without a deal after host Brazil released a draft agreement on Friday that made no mention of ""fossil fuels"" or a ""roadmap"" that President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had himself publicly championed. After negotiating through the night, EU ministers were meeting on Saturday, but French ecological transition minister Monique Barbut said things were going ""nowhere so far.""

GE2025 ballot papers and other documents incinerated - Yahoo News Singapore,"SINGAPORE – More than 2.4 million ballot papers and other documents used in the 2025 General Election were set alight on Nov 22, part of the process to ensure the secrecy of the vote. The sealed boxes containing the papers and documents were removed in the morning from the Supreme Court vault and transported to the Tuas South Incineration Plant. The move is in accordance with the Parliamentary Elections Act. Under the law, ballot papers and other documents used in an election must be sealed and kept in safe custody for six months after they are counted at the end of polling, in case of any legal challenges. They are then destroyed in front of witnesses – including election candidates from the various parties, their agents, as well as election department officials – to ensure that the votes stay secret.

The 200-year-old paintings blocked from leaving the UK - Yahoo News Singapore,"A unique collection of vibrant Hindu paintings has been placed under an export bar, preventing their departure from the UK. The Devi Mahatmya series, which vividly illustrates the narrative of Hinduism’s Divine Mother, is valued at £280,000, according to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). A DCMS spokesperson highlighted that the 56 paintings offer a significant opportunity for the study of this artistic genre. The export prohibition aims to provide a UK gallery or institution with sufficient time to acquire the works for the nation. This nearly complete series portrays one of Hinduism’s most crucial narratives, utilising gold and silver paint to depict scenes ranging from serene worship to intense battles. Among the 200-year-old artworks is a painting showing the defeated gods Vishnu and Shiva appealing for assistance, a scene believed to be unique to this particular collection.

Over 220 pupils and teachers kidnapped from Nigerian school - Yahoo News Singapore,"Gunmen kidnapped 227 pupils and teachers from a Catholic school in central Nigeria, officials said Friday, in the second brazen school abduction in a week. All of the 215 students taken from St Mary's school in Niger state were girls, according to a spokesman for the Christian Association of Nigeria which added that 12 teachers were also abducted. Amid mounting fears over security in Africa's most populous nation, authorities in the nearby states of Katsina and Plateau ordered all schools to close as a precautionary measure. The Niger state government closed many schools. President Bola Tiubu cancelled international engagements, including attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg, to handle the crisis which came after gunmen on Monday stormed a secondary school in Kebbi state in northwestern Nigeria, abducting 25 girls.

Harry Potter star Rupert Grint: 'I'll never leave Ron's shadow',"Rupert Grint has told the BBC he’s unlikely to ever ""step out"" of Ron Weasley's shadow, some 14 years after the release of the final Harry Potter film. ""I'm fine with that. I think it's great,"" he said. ""I love meeting people who really felt this was part of their childhood."" Grint, 37, who played Ron in all eight of the franchise's movies, also revealed he has written a letter to the child actor playing Ron in the upcoming TV series. ""It's quite strange to have the cycle happening again,"" he said. ""I'm really intrigued what it's going to be like."" Grint was speaking to BBC News at an event to switch on the Christmas lights in Highgate, north London, on Wednesday. The actor, who lives locally with his partner, actress Georgia Groome, and their two daughters, drew a crowd of fans to the Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution and Highgate Society.

Do mushroom and protein 'functional' coffees have health benefits?,"Zak Haddad has been kickstarting his day with a cup of coffee infused with lion's mane - a type of mushroom - for the past three years. He says it gives him a ""really clear, focused feeling"", without the ""spike and crash you can sometimes get from strong coffee"". Coffees made with extra ingredients like mushrooms, protein and collagen are known as ""functional coffees"" - which aim to provide consumers with benefits beyond the typical caffeine boost. For years they've been a familiar sight in the aisles of health food stores, but more recently they've been cropping up in high street coffee shops too. So when Zak opened his own coffee shop - Sipp in Chorlton, Greater Manchester - in late 2023, he was eager to include mushroom coffees on the menu. Zak's shop has four different types of mushroom powder on its menu, which he says all have different benefits. Customers can pay an extra £1 to add a mushroom powder or a supplement called collagen to drinks from lattes to cappuccinos. Coffee...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp85815r7m0o,23/11/2025
Vietnam floods leave at least 90 dead and 12 missing,"At least 90 people have died and another 12 are missing after days of heavy rain in Vietnam led to flooding and landslides. The Vietnamese government says 186,000 homes have been damaged across the country, with more than three million livestock swept away. Officials estimate there has been hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage. The mountainous province of Dak Lak has been severely impacted, recording more than 60 deaths since 16 November, according to news agency AFP. The floods are the latest extreme weather event to hit Vietnam in recent months, after typhoons Kalmaegi and Bualoi hit the country within weeks of each other. Some 258,000 people were without power on Sunday morning and sections of major motorways and train tracks were blocked, officials said. Military and police resources have been mobilised to assist in the hardest hit areas.

Rubio hails 'tremendous progress' at Ukraine peace talks,"A ""tremendous amount of progress"" has been achieved in talks to finalise a US-proposed peace plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said. But ""there's still some work to be done"", Rubio said after meeting Ukrainian and European negotiators in Geneva, Switzerland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were ""signals that President [Donald] Trump's team is hearing us"". Ukraine and its European allies had expressed concern over the leaked proposals, seen as favouring Russia and welcomed by Vladimir Putin as ""the basis"" for settlement. Zelensky had said Ukraine ""might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner"". Speaking to reporters late on Sunday, Rubio said the negotiating teams in Geneva had had a ""very good day"". He said the main goal had been to try to narrow ""open items"" from the 28-point US plan - and the parties involved had achieved that in a ""substantial way"".

'We worry more about food' say Venezuelans living under threat of US military action,"While Nicolás Maduro's government lives on edge under a military threat from US President Donald Trump, ordinary Venezuelans spend their time trying to figure out what to eat each day. It's Wednesday morning at Quinta Crespo, a popular market in downtown Caracas. Here, a possible escalation of the conflict is not the main concern of Venezuelans, who glance at the news while checking their wallets to find enough cash to pay. ""There's not going to be an intervention, nothing like that. What's really troubling us is the rise of the dollar,"" Alejandro Orellano tells BBC Mundo as he savours a coffee, waiting for customers who never seem to arrive. In the past weeks, Trump's government has deployed thousands of troops and military assets to within striking distance of Venezuela, including the world's largest warship.

How Marjorie Taylor Greene went from Trump ally to quitting Congress,"Marjorie Taylor Greene came into Congress as one of Donald Trump's staunchest defenders. Sworn into office just days before the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, Greene supported the president - and echoed his contention that the 2020 presidential election was ""stolen"" - when many in the Republican Party disavowed him. Now, five years later, Greene will leave Congress having been branded a ""traitor"" by the man she once revered. Over the course of just a handful of months, Greene broke with Trump in the most dramatic fashion. Although Greene had criticised Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran, his support for Israel during the Gaza War and a lack of sufficient regulation of big technology companies earlier this year, the final fracture began over Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile who had connections to the wealthy and powerful. She condemned Trump's unwillingness to order his justice department to fully release its files on the case, and...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywjz202r7o,22/11/2025
Donald Glover reveals he had a stroke last year,"American actor and rapper Donald Glover, who performs as Childish Gambino, revealed on stage during a concert that he had a stroke last year. While performing at Tyler, the Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw festival in Los Angeles on Saturday night, Glover opened up about the reason he had to cancel his tour not long after it began in 2024. ""I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway,"" Glover said on stage. ""I couldn't really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, 'You had a stroke.'"" About a month after his New World tour began in August 2024, Glover postponed the tour, and then later cancelled the remaining dates, citing health issues.

Players Championship Finals: Luke Littler wins first title by defeating Nathan Aspinall - BBC Sport,"Luke Littler overtook Luke Humphries at the top of the rankings on his way to the Grand Slam of Darts victory last week World number one Luke Littler captured his first Players Championship Finals title with a 11-8 victory over fellow Englishman Nathan Aspinall in Minehead. The 18-year-old, who was beaten in last year's final by Luke Humphries, added a new trophy to his cabinet just a week after lifting the Grand Slam of Darts in Wolverhampton and topping the world rankings for the first time. Aspinall battled hard in the decider, reducing the deficit to 9-8 at one stage by winning four out of five legs, but Littler held firm and hit a checkout of 88 to secure his sixth televised title. ""I am very proud to get this one ticked off the list - only two more to go now,"" Littler told ITV after the win. The only major trophies missing from Littler's collection now are the European Championship and the World Masters.

England 27-23 Argentina: Max Ojomoh stars as hosts revel in winning habit - BBC Sport,"Immanuel Feyi-Waboso has seven tries in 13 caps for England Nobody was pretending that England don't have room for improvement. With the players out on their feet, the Twickenham air still humming with tension, Argentina aggrieved and the England bench relieved, they couldn't. The skinny look to the scoreboard - a 27-23 victory - matched with frayed nerves and chewed fingernails. England's attack was aimless, bordering on clueless, on occasions. Fourteen penalties conceded was plenty too many. Thirteen unanswered Pumas points at the start of the second half was a worrying loss of control. The defence flagged alarmingly late on, losing speed and structure as Argentina scored a last-minute try and came within metres of a last-play clincher. All true. But, equally unarguable, was an 11th straight win, a first four-Test autumn sweep since 2016 and the fact that they have found a way in 2025. A year ago, they were bounced and bullied out of matches on three successive weekends. New...",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cn98d8ez0g8o,23/11/2025
Cristiano Ronaldo scores overhead kick in Saudi Pro League for Al-Nassr - BBC Sport,"This video can not be played 40-year-old Ronaldo scores stunning overhead kick Cristiano Ronaldo rolled back the years by scoring a stunning overhead kick in Al-Nassr's 4-1 win over Al-Khaleej in the Saudi Pro League. The 40-year-old rose in the middle of the penalty area to meet Nawaf Boushal's right-wing cross in the sixth minute of stoppage time at Al-Awwal Park in Riyadh. It was Ronaldo's 954th career goal and was reminiscent of his bicycle kick for Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final against Juventus in 2018. The Portugal captain also scored an overhead kick against Poland in the Nations League in November 2024. Victory took Al-Nassr four points clear at the top of the table.

Arsenal 4-1 Tottenham: Eberechi Eze's 'special day' - but can anyone challenge Gunners for title? - BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Eze fires hat-trick as Arsenal thrash Tottenham It has been another huge weekend for Arsenal. A fortnight after the Gunners' surprise draw at Sunderland gave their Premier League title rivals new hope, Sunday's resounding win over Tottenham has put them firmly back in the hot seat. Eberechi Eze, a Spurs summer target, was the hero, scoring his first hat-trick in senior football and the first in a north London derby since 1978 as Arsenal thrashed Tottenham 4-1 in an ominous display for the rest of the league. A day after defending champions Liverpool fell to a sixth loss in seven matches and Manchester City were beaten at Newcastle, Mikel Arteta's men had no such problems to move six points clear of second-placed Chelsea. This felt like a statement win for Arsenal against their bitter rivals - who went into the game unbeaten away from home all season - given Gabriel, Martin Odegaard, Kai Havertz and Viktor Gyokores are on the hosts' injury list.

Tourist tax expected to be introduced for London,"The mayor of London has cautiously welcomed reports that he is to impose a tourist levy on visitors staying overnight in the capital. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to give Sir Sadiq Khan and other civic chiefs the authority to do so through the English Devolution and Community Empowerment Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. Sir Sadiq has been vocal in calling for such powers to be devolved, with estimates suggesting a tourist tax in London could raise up to £240m a year. In 2024, London saw 89 million overnight stays. Currently England is the only country among the G7 (Group of Seven) - the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies - where national government prevents local authorities or mayors from implementing tourist levies. Scotland and Wales have both recently introduced different types of taxes on overnight visitors, with local authorities in the former able to set their own levy as a percentage rate of the daily bill for accommodation.

Inside the rise of a £1m Glastonbury tickets scammer,"Miles Hart had a reputation as a guy who could get anything. Friends from the elite private school he used to attend say he once surprised them with an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris on a private jet with less than 24 hours notice. So when he started selling Glastonbury tickets, hospitality passes and VIP Access All Areas passes - claiming he had privileged access because of land his family owned near the festival site, or by working with a company at the event - many of his former schoolmates jumped at the chance. Within a couple of years, his sales had gone global, as he struck deals to sell about £1m of passes to punters who had missed out in the annual scramble for official tickets on the Glastonbury website. But as the day of the 2024 festival approached, Miles's promises of tickets proved to be a mirage, created out of false invoices and fake email addresses. Miles, now 27, went into hiding. How did Miles Hart get away with it? The BBC has spoken to some of his former friends...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2e2yzyzvlo,23/11/2025
How robots are a lifeline to troops on Ukraine's eastern front,"""The toy is delivered,"" a Ukrainian soldier whispers into the radio. In the dead of night, he and his partner move quickly to roll out their cargo from a van. Speed is crucial as they are within the range of deadly Russian drones. The fifth brigade's new ""toy"" is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), a robot that provides a lifeline for Ukrainian troops at the front in Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces are relentlessly trying to cut off Ukraine's supply routes in the area. Without fresh food and ammunition, Ukraine's frontline soldiers would face a choice of either surrender or a costly retreat. Kyiv has sent special forces, elite assault units and drone groups to reinforce its troops in and around Pokrovsk, but Russia's grip on routes into the city means going in with armoured vehicles would bring almost certain death. Transporting heavy supplies on foot would be just as dangerous. This is where the robot, also known as a land drone, comes in...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgkg4zr33lo,23/11/2025
"Seven arrested in India after police crack $800,000 bank heist","Seven people have been arrested in India after a daring 70m rupees ($800,000; £600,000) heist in which armed men posing as central bank officials robbed an ATM cash van. On Saturday police in the southern city of Bengaluru said they had cracked the case and recovered 57.6m rupees of the money stolen three days earlier. Bengaluru police commissioner Seemant Kumar Singh told the BBC on Sunday that a seventh man had been arrested in Bengaluru, adding it would take time to determine the amount of money ""in his possession."" Singh said the police are still looking ""for two or, maybe, three more,"" suspects. Those arrested include Gopal Prasad, an employee of cash transport company CMS, J Xavier, a former CMS worker, and Annappa Naik, a local police constable.

For Flavio Cobolli, the faces cheering for him from the sidelines provided the extra impetus he needed as he fought to realise his dream of becoming a world champion. The 23-year-old secured a historic third successive Davis Cup title for Italy by battling back from a set and a break down against Spain's Jaume Munar to seal a 2-0 triumph in front of an jubilant home crowd in Bologna. Cobolli's gritty 1-6 7-6 (7-5) 7-5 victory, achieved two days after he confirmed Italy's place in Sunday's showpiece by winning an epic 32-point tie-break, followed Matteo Berrettini's 6-3 6-4 win over Pablo Carreno Busta.

Why Tommy Robinson supporters are turning to Christianity,"Gareth Talbot does not necessarily believe in God, but he's started going to church. He felt compelled to do so after taking part in one of Tommy Robinson's rallies in September. ""I never thought I had to choose before, but now I'm feeling like Christianity could be replaced, so that's why I feel the church needs support,"" the 36-year-old from Bradford says. Gareth talks about the church in England being under ""threat"", as he sees it, mainly from Islam. He says his concern is about the extreme elements of Islam, not the religion as a whole. He also makes claims about all the Christmas markets in London being renamed ""festive markets"" and about some areas of the country becoming ""fully Muslim"", as other reasons for feeling a need to engage more with Christianity. Having now returned to the church he used to attend as a child with his grandmother in Little Horton, Bradford, Gareth says he wants to take more of an interest in what is going on there.

Who killed young Chechen woman who fled Russia for a life of freedom?,"When 23-year-old Aishat Baimuradova fled her home earlier this year, she believed she finally had a chance to live the way she wanted. Coming from Chechnya, a conservative Muslim republic in Russia, she cut her hair short, stopped covering her head, shaved off part of her eyebrow and posted quirky selfies on Instagram. She told her new friends she could finally breathe. In October, Aishat was found dead in a rented flat in neighbouring Armenia. Police say she was murdered. Two people were seen leaving the building where she was found, including a woman Aishat had befriended not long before her death. Both reportedly left for Russia soon afterwards. Russians do not need a passport to enter Armenia; their internal ID is enough. That also makes it an easy route for anyone trying to flee. Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus, is often described by rights groups as a state within a state - a place where power is highly personalised and loyalty to long-standing leader Ramzan Kadyrov often...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwgx803l5o,23/11/2025
Japan's gamble to turn island of flowers into global chip hub,"The island of Hokkaido has long been an agricultural powerhouse – now Japan is investing billions to turn it into a global hub for advanced semiconductors. More than half of Japan's dairy produce comes from Hokkaido, the northernmost of its main islands. In winter, it's a wonderland of ski resorts and ice-sculpture festivals; in summer, fields bloom with bands of lavender, poppies and sunflowers. These days, cranes are popping up across the island – building factories, research centres and universities focused on technology. It's part of Japan's boldest industrial push in a generation: an attempt to reboot the country's chip-making capabilities and reshape its economic future. Locals say that beyond the cattle and tourism, Hokkaido has long lacked other industries. There's even a saying that those who go there do so only to leave. But if the government succeeds in turning Hokkaido into Japan's answer to Silicon Valley - or ""Hokkaido Valley"", as some have begun to call it - the country...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8676qpxgnqo,23/11/2025
Jair Bolsonaro says ankle monitor damage caused by paranoia,"Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president convicted of plotting a coup, has blamed medicine-induced ""paranoia"" for damage he caused to his ankle monitor - a day after he was removed from house arrest into detention. At a hearing in Brasília, he admitted trying to open the monitor with a soldering iron on Friday until he ""came to his senses"", court documents show. He said he had had no intention of fleeing. Officials say the right-wing politician, 70, was taken into custody because he was a flight risk ahead of a supporters' vigil outside his home. He will remain in detention. In September, Bolsonaro was sentenced to more than 27 years in prison for the coup plot. Bolsonaro is being held in a police station in the capital. His legal woes have drawn the ire of fellow right-wing populist US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.

Mumbai's glorious Art Deco legacy at 100,"It was at a landmark architecture exhibition in Paris in 1925 that the Art Deco aesthetic first exploded on the scene. In the 100 years since, the glamorous building style - evocative of neon-lit jazz bars and the golden age of big motion pictures - rapidly spread around the world. It moved from the famous pastel hotel facades of Miami's South Beach to the sprawling necklace of mansion apartments along Mumbai's Marine Drive seafront. Art Deco's distinct motifs - typified by geometrical ziggurats (step towers), sweeping curves, sunburst designs, nautical elements and circular or turreted rooftops - symbolised an unequivocal break from the past, celebrating the dawn of a new, unabashed, post-war 20th Century modern age. In a short time, the style transcended architecture to influence the design sensibility of home interiors, furniture, fonts, jewellery and some of the world's most iconic cinema halls - from Radio City Music Hall in New York City to Regal, Liberty and Eros cinemas in...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p2xp19r3o,23/11/2025
Fifty children escape after mass school abduction in Nigeria,"Fifty of the 315 children kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in Nigeria's Niger State on Friday have escaped. The Christian Association of Nigeria says they have been reunited with their families. A major military-led search and rescue operation is under way for the remaining 265 children and 12 teachers who were taken with them. Authorities in several Nigerian states ordered schools to shut following the mass abduction in Niger and another smaller hostage-taking in Kebbi state on Monday when 20 pupils were kidnapped from a boarding school.

Ethiopia-Eritrea: Escalating war of words triggers fears of conflict,"There are growing concerns over the possibility of armed conflict between Horn of Africa neighbours, Ethiopia and Eritrea, as hostile rhetoric has ratcheted up in recent weeks. Landlocked Ethiopia's calls for access to the Red Sea through Eritrea has triggered a fierce war of words. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed first openly declared in 2023 that his nation's access to the sea was an existential matter, comments that Eritrea dismissed. Relations between the two countries have frequently been strained. After a decades-long battle for independence, Eritrea, which has a 1,350km (840-mile) Red Sea coastline, officially seceded from Ethiopia in 1993, leaving it landlocked. Five years later, a border war erupted in which more than 100,000 people died. Abiy and army chief Field Marshal Birhanu Jula have openly claimed ownership of Eritrea's southern port of Assab – about 60km from the border - and hinted at the desire to take it by force. On 1 September, Abiy said Ethiopia's ""mistake""...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwg042vr4o,23/11/2025

They said five sites had been hit, including residential homes. A senior Hamas commander was among the dead, according to local sources. The Israeli military said it had struck targets in Gaza in response to an incident earlier on Saturday, when it said an ""armed terrorist"" had fired at soldiers after crossing the Strip's so-called ""yellow line"" designating areas under full Israeli control.

An unusual trend in the economy is worrying the Fed | CNN Business,"Something in the US economy isn‚Äôt adding up, and it‚Äôs rattling the people charged with wrangling inflation and keeping the labor market intact.

Yet workers‚Äô productivity, a key driver of economic output, remains high. And gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, has stayed robust.

Justice Department again asks judge to unseal Epstein grand jury testimony | CNN Politics,"The Justice Department has asked a federal judge in Florida to reconsider unsealing grand jury materials related to an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, as the agency faces a congressionally-mandated deadline to release all documents related to the accused sex trafficker next month. A judge in the Southern District of Florida previously denied a request by the DOJ to make public transcripts from the case, which federal prosecutors asked for due to ‚Äúextensive public interest‚Äù but not as part of a judicial proceeding. Epstein committed many of his crimes in Florida. When a Florida judge denied the DOJ‚Äôs original request, she said her ‚Äúhands are tied‚Äù because the Justice Department sought to release the sealed evidence due to ‚Äúextensive public interest,‚Äù not as part of a judicial proceeding, which is the usual standard.

Leonid Ragozin is a freelance journalist based in Riga. On November 10, the Ukrainian anticorruption authorities revealed that close associates of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were allegedly involved in a scheme to embezzle $100m from Ukraine’s energy sector. Zelenskyy’s business partner Tymur Mindich as well as two government ministers have been named so far in the investigation, led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), an agency backed by Western governments. Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated. The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive.

Venezuela: A not-so-covert CIA disaster in the making | Politics | Al Jazeera,"Venezuela doesn’t even produce fentanyl, but Washington is still going forward with regime change efforts in Caracas as part of its ‘war on drugs’. Al Jazeera columnist. On Saturday, the Reuters news agency published an exclusive report claiming that the United States is “poised to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations in the coming days”. The report cited four US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two of the officials said covert operations would likely be the first step in this “new action” against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. This was less than shocking news given that more than a month ago, US President Donald Trump himself announced that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela – a rather unique approach since one does not normally broadcast actions that are supposed to be, um, secret.

"How 2 NFL teams are winning the game of inches, stealing yards on the ‘dynamic kickoff’ - The Athletic","The Athletic has live coverage of Buccaneers vs. Rams in NFL ‘Sunday Night Football.’ In the NFL, cliches are a way of life. Players use them, coaches rely on them, and we in the media hate them. Annoying as they are, however, they can sometimes do a decent job of getting at the heart of a matter. So, as you embark on this story about how teams are taking advantage of the NFL’s new kickoff rules, the cliche to keep in mind is the Vince Lombardi classic, “Football is a game of inches.” Personally, I’ve always found the cliche to be a tad dramatic — it’s really more of a game of yards, though admittedly, that doesn’t roll off the tongue — but the sentiment is the key here. NFL teams spend millions of dollars every year examining the nooks and crannies of the game, hunting for even the tiniest of advantages as they try to steal away one yard at a time from their opponents. The latest evolution of that hunt has come on the NFL’s new “dynamic kickoffs.” Some teams have adapted quite well...",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6820928/2025/11/21/nfl-dyanmic-kickoffs-seahawks-panthers/,23/11/2025

Glover, a five-time Grammy winner known for high-energy performances under his rap alter ego Childish Gambino, shared the details during a performance at Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw, a music festival held this weekend at Dodger Stadium. “I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana, and I did the show anyway,” Glover told the audience, referring to a concert in 2024, according to widely circulated video clips on social media. “I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital, and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke.’” Doctors later discovered a hole in his heart,...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/arts/music/donald-glover-childish-gambino-stroke.html,23/11/2025

Denmark’s Migration Model - The New York Times,"The country is getting attention for its tough asylum policies. Can they serve as a bulwark against the far right? I’m the host of The World. The center-left Labour government in Britain made waves last week when it announced harsh new rules for asylum seekers. The proposal would make refugee status subject to frequent review and staying long-term much harder: Obtaining permanent residency would take at least 20 years. It also includes policies that some critics have deemed “performative cruelty,” such as confiscating jewelry from asylum seekers to help pay for food and housing costs. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is trying to address a question haunting many centrist governments in this moment of rising populism: How do you respond to the concerns voters have about immigration while remaining true to liberal values?

"Opinion | America’s Housing Crisis, in One Chart - The New York Times","The housing market keeps getting worse. Home prices have risen more than 50 percent since the pandemic. About a third of Americans households now spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. In 2014, the median age of a first-time home buyer was 31. In 2025, it was 40 — the highest on record. The core of the problem is simple: Too much money chasing too few homes. How many more homes does America need? I’ve seen estimates ranging from two million to five million. It’s a shortage decades in the making — and one we’re nowhere near on track to solving. In 2025, America built fewer homes per 100,000 people than it did in 2005, 1995, 1985 or 1975.

Opinion | How the Elite Behave When No One Is Watching: Inside the Epstein Emails - The New York Times,"By Anand Giridharadas Mr. Giridharadas is the author of “Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World” and publisher of The.Ink newsletter. As journalists comb through the Epstein emails, surfacing the name of one fawning luminary after another, there is a collective whisper of “How could they?” How could such eminent people, belonging to such prestigious institutions, succumb to this? A close read of the thousands of messages makes it less surprising. When Jeffrey Epstein, a financier turned convicted sex offender, needed friends to rehabilitate him, he knew where to turn: a power elite practiced at disregarding pain. At the dark heart of this story is a sex criminal and his victims — and his enmeshment with President Trump. But it is also a tale about a powerful social network in which some, depending on what they knew, were perhaps able to look away because they had learned to look away from so much other abuse and suffering: the financial meltdowns some in the network...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/opinion/meaning-epstein-emails.html,23/11/2025
"Which NFL Week 12 games have biggest impact on playoff races, No. 1 pick chances? - The Athletic","A loss to the Colts would deal a major blow to the Chiefs' playoff chances. Jamie Schwaberow / Getty Images The Athletic has live coverage of NFL Week 12. As Thanksgiving approaches, games across the NFL start to have added layers of significance. Some teams have set themselves up to be fighting for playoff seeding while others are fighting just to get into the dance. On the flip side of the standings, there are a cluster of teams whose 2025 seasons have gone south but have hope for reinforcements with premium draft picks. Only one team can land the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, so the race to the bottom is almost as intriguing for the rest of the regular season as the playoff picture.

Mamdani’s Meeting With Trump Scrambled the MAGA-Sphere - The New York Times,"Prominent conservative influencers had different interpretations as they processed the meeting on podcasts and in social media posts. By Nathan Taylor Pemberton It was a break-the-internet moment if there ever was one. Unpredictable, at times perplexing and rich, with the kinds of surreal moments social media feeds on. After Friday’s meeting between President Trump and Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York, certain corners of the internet did, in fact, appear to be broken — or at least temporarily off-kilter — including the sprawling online ecosystem that has emerged from the Make America Great Again movement. This raucous hive, which tends to hype up every win by the president, was uncharacteristically muted in response to the meeting with Mr. Mamdani.

Zelensky Is Under Pressure from Trump and Domestically - The New York Times,"Over nearly four years of wartime leadership, analysts say the Ukrainian leader has repeatedly played weak hands wisely. A U.S. peace plan may be his biggest test. By Cassandra Vinograd and Andrew E. Kramer Reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine It is another make-or-break moment of wartime leadership for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Late last week, the Trump administration delivered to Mr. Zelensky a 28-point peace plan that many Ukrainians and their Western allies have called a wish list for Russia, a reward for its aggression and a betrayal of Ukraine.

Opinion | Listening to a Book Counts as Reading - The New York Times,"Credit...Alexander Coggin for The New York Times Mr. Bannon is the chief librarian at the New York Public Library, where he is also director of branch libraries and education. As a librarian, I get a lot of questions. One I am hearing more often is: Do audiobooks qualify as reading? Many people don’t think so. There is a pride — even a snobbishness — to being well read. Telling someone that you have only listened to a certain book usually comes out sounding like an apology. A recent NPR-Ipsos poll found that 41 percent of adults don’t believe audiobooks qualify as reading. One friend of mine, who argues with his husband over this, once memorably told me that listening to a book felt like seeing a musical in New Jersey instead of on a Broadway stage. Close, but not the real thing. I used to feel the same way myself. A few years ago, sitting in an airport bar, I noticed a man next to me scrolling through his phone as a robotic voice read every word aloud at high speed. At first, I...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/opinion/audiobooks-books-print-reading.html,23/11/2025
F.B.I. Letters Send Shivers Through California’s Political Inner Circle - The New York Times,"The indictment of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff shocked many power players in California. Now, some wonder how far the investigation will spread. Laurel Rosenhall has reported on California politics and lobbying in Sacramento since 2011. This is third F.B.I. corruption sting that she has covered at the State Capitol. California lobbyists soaked in the sun at a Maui resort last week, attending conference sessions about energy and manufacturing in the morning, and relaxing on the beach in the afternoon. For them, it was an annual escape after spending much of the year trying to muscle laws through the state legislature in Sacramento. But in between policy discussions, the tropical luxury was occasionally interrupted by the question on everyone’s mind: Letters from the F.B.I. landed this month in the mailboxes of California’s political class, notifying recipients that their phone calls and text messages were captured on a wiretap last year. The unwelcome correspondence began...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/us/california-fbi-state-capitol-corruption.html,23/11/2025
Opinion | This Is How Our Economy Comes Crashing Down - The New York Times,"Credit...Eric Helgas for The New York Times Ms. Patterson is an economist who has held senior positions at JPMorgan Chase and Bridgewater Associates. In the game of Jenga, players remove wooden blocks from a tower and place them on the top. With each move, the tower gets taller and increasingly unstable, until it collapses. Welcome to the American economy of 2025. Economic growth is robust and stock markets are hovering around record highs. Set on a foundation of supportive fiscal and monetary policy, the tower appears sturdy enough. But a closer inspection shows that an increasing number of structural supports — across businesses, labor markets, consumers and stocks — are looking wobbly. A Jenga-like collapse, meaning an unexpected economic downturn, is not inevitable. But it is a growing, underappreciated possibility. One of the most critical economic Jenga blocks removed this year has been small American companies, especially those focused on trade.

The best NFL games on TV for the rest of 2025: Defending champs vs. defending MVP - The Athletic,"Jalen Hurts and the Eagles vs. the Bills could be the most-watched NFL game of the season. Tim Nwachukwu / Getty Images We have reached the moment in the NFL calendar where the chill in the air hits you square. The autumn wind that reminds one of those old-school NFL Films, narrated by the legendary John Facenda. (“Dick Butkus is a middle linebacker. Trained for nothing else but these coming moments of body contact. … Tackling is his means of self-expression. Violence is his lifestyle.”) The league, as always, continues to be watched by droves of football-hungry Americans. NFL games had averaged 17.7 million viewers through Week 11. That’s up six percent over 2024 and 2023 — and the highest average through Week 11 since 2015. Of the top 65 shows on linear television since the start of the 2025 season, the NFL is responsible for 60 of those broadcasts.

Now the company has made its chatbot safer. Will that undermine its quest for growth? Credit...Julia Dufosse By Kashmir Hill and Jennifer Valentino-DeVries It sounds like science fiction: A company turns a dial on a product used by hundreds of millions of people and inadvertently destabilizes some of their minds. But that is essentially what happened at OpenAI this year. One of the first signs came in March. Sam Altman, the chief executive, and other company leaders got an influx of puzzling emails from people who were having incredible conversations with ChatGPT. These people said the company’s A.I. chatbot understood them as no person ever had and was shedding light on mysteries of the universe. Mr. Altman forwarded the messages to a few lieutenants and asked them to look into it. “That got it on our radar as something we should be paying attention to in terms of this new behavior we hadn’t...",https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/technology/openai-chatgpt-users-risks.html,23/11/2025
Can the World Move On Without the U.S.? G20 Leaders Gave It a Shot. - The New York Times,"With the United States boycotting the summit, other nations sought to strike new deals, and some took a tougher tone with President Trump. Reporting from Johannesburg President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa could not contain his laughter. A reporter asked him to confirm reports that the United States had dropped its boycott and asked to participate in the Group of 20 summit in Johannesburg just two days before it was set to start. The South African leader barely uttered a word before breaking down in laughter, eventually composing himself and saying he had received a note from the Americans “about a change of mind.” President Trump’s spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, later said that Mr. Ramaphosa’s language was “not appreciated by the president or his team.” Just a few weeks ago, that sort of scolding from the White House would have set off slight panic in the South African government, and perhaps drawn an explanation from Mr. Ramaphosa for his departure from diplomatic decorum.

Arsenal’s Eberechi Eze finds own plane just above ground level to sink Spurs | Arsenal | The Guardian,"The England forward has made a decent start to his Emirates career but this performance was stick-it-on-a-mural stuff Has there ever been a softer, more delicate act of derby day brutality than this, a hat-trick in a 4-1 win where every goal must have felt like being bludgeoned to death with a feather‑light Parisian macaron? Eberechi Eze’s third goal, the killer, the legend-maker, was the funniest, and also the most telling. It was made by a thrust down the left, and by Leandro Trossard’s smart pass. But it was made as an aesthetic by Destiny Udogie falling over, not because of any real act of trickery, but because Eze stopped suddenly, out there in the middle of all that heat and light, taking the ball on the edge of the Spurs box and simply ceasing to move, like a squirrel on a branch. Udogie tried to follow and slipped, leaving Eze in his own clean, clear pocket of space to slip the ball into the corner of the Tottenham net.

"Maga is in meltdown over a preppy pink sweater for men. So, what exactly is the problem? | Ellie Violet Bramley | The Guardian","The outrage a J Crew jumper has provoked shows that the US right’s sense of masculinity is far more fragile than it would care to admit A men’s jumper by the all-American preppy label J Crew has sent thousands of Maga Americans into meltdown. From a fashion point of view, it couldn’t be more innocuous. It’s got a crew neck. It’s made from wool. It has a Fair Isle pattern at the upper yoke. There’s nothing asymmetric about it, no fringing or tassels, no slogan blasted across the front; no “Make America Kind Again”. So what’s the big deal? Reader, the jumper is pink. The main storm broke underneath a tweet by conservative social media commentator Juanita Broaddrick, in which she asked: “Are you kidding me?? Men, would you wear this $168 sweater?” The consensus among her followers was a resounding no, and not because of its price. “No man in my family would wear it!” wrote “MOMof DataRepublican”. “My husband wouldn’t use a pink bathroom towel,” assured another.

"Eberechi Eze adds an ‘aura’ to Arsenal, says delighted Mikel Arteta | Arsenal | The Guardian","‘When a player has such a talent, these things happen’ Frank ‘disappointed’ by Spurs’ performance in 4-1 loss Mikel Arteta credited Eberechi Eze for adding an “aura” to the Arsenal team after he scored the first hat-trick of his career to haunt Tottenham and send Arsenal six points clear at the top of the Premier League. Eze was close to joining Spurs from Crystal Palace in the summer before they were gazumped by their north London rivals and the England international made them pay after Leandro Trossard had opened the scoring. A mesmerising dribble and finish made it 2-0 at half-time before Eze doubled his tally 36 seconds after the restart. He rounded off the scoring following Richarlison’s fine consolation strike for a Tottenham side that showed little ambition throughout and recorded 0.07 expected goals. “Things happen for a reason,” said the Arsenal manager, whose side recorded three successive runners-up finishes before Eze’s signing for £67.5m in the summer. “After the...",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/23/eberechi-eze-adds-an-aura-to-arsenal-says-delighted-mikel-arteta,23/11/2025

Titanic passenger’s pocket watch sold for record £1.78m at auction | The Titanic | The Guardian,"The 18-carat Jules Jurgensen gold watch belonged to Isidor Straus, who along with his wife lost his life when ship sank A gold pocket watch that belonged to a man who died onboard the Titanic when it sank has sold for a record sum. The watch, which belonged to 67-year-old Isidor Straus, went for £1.78m at auction, the highest amount ever paid for Titanic memorabilia.

How to make the perfect butter paneer – recipe | Curry | The Guardian,"Which versions of this much-loved and widely adapted rich vegetarian curry will be distilled into the perfect take? This luxuriantly rich, vegetarian curry – a cousin of butter chicken, which is thought to have been created in the postwar kitchens of Delhi’s Moti Mahal, though by whom is the subject of hot dispute – is, according to chef Vivek Singh, “the most famous and widely interpreted dish in India”. His fellow chef Sanjeev Kapoor describes it as “one of the bestselling dishes in restaurants” there, but here in the UK, though it’s no doubt widely enjoyed, it seems to fly somewhat under the radar on menus, where even the chicken original plays second fiddle to our beloved chicken tikka masala. If you haven’t yet fallen for the crowdpleasing charms of fresh cheese in a mild tomato sauce, consider this a strong suggestion to give it a whirl.

The loneliness fix: I wanted to find new friends in my 30s – and it was easier than I imagined | Friendship | The Guardian,"It is said to be harder to make friends as you age. But I found that a mix of apps and other tools, as well as a happy attitude, led to a world of potential new pals Tonight, Rachel, Elvira and I will meet for dinner.

But now, here we are, something as close to firm friends as is possible after such a short time. If you’ve ever consumed any media, you would be forgiven for thinking that life after 35 is a burning wasteland of unimaginable horrors: the beginnings of incessant back pain, an interest in dishwasher loading, the discovery that you’re ineligible for entire industries billed as “a young person’s game”, and, apparently, an inability to make friends. “It becomes harder to make friends as you get older,” goes the adage, and indeed, 69% of people in a US survey by Talker Research agree that making close friends becomes more difficult as you age.

"I’m hiking in the Dolomites, Italy’s magical mountains – if only I could see them! | Dolomites holidays | The Guardian","Poor weather couldn’t spoil my high-altitude walking trip amid these stunning peaks, especially with delicious, hearty Tyrolean cuisine to keep me going When you come to the Dolomites for winter walking, it’s with the intention of having spellbinding snow-streaked peaks that are unlike anything else in the Alps as your constant companion. But with impenetrable cloud and heavy rain forecast, it was hard not to feel deflated. Then again, this was Italy, where it’s easy to make the best of things whatever the weather. And the 3 Zinnen Dolomites ski resort and nature park – right on Italy’s border with Austria, about two-and-a-half hours north of Venice, is always charming, with the usual jumble of cultures you see in South Tyrol. Part Italian, it’s more Austrian thanks to the legacy of the Habsburgs, who ruled this part of Italy until 1918. Hence most places have an Austrian and an Italian name, 3 Zinnen or Tre Cime (meaning three peaks) being a case in point.

The Guardian view on animal testing: we can stop sacrificing millions of lives for our own health | Editorial | The Guardian,"New technologies can reduce our reliance on animal experiments. This isn’t just morally right, it could have scientific and economic benefits too Science is a slaughterhouse. We rarely acknowledge the degree to which animal life underwrites the research that provides us with medicines, or the regulation that keeps us safe. Live animals were used in 2.64m officially sanctioned scientific procedures in the UK in 2024, many of them distressing or painful and many of them fatal. But the government’s new strategy to phase out animal testing – published earlier this month – suggests that in the near future emerging technologies can largely replace the use of animals in our scientific endeavours. The UK previously banned cosmetics testing on animals, and has already taken steps to regulate and reduce their use in research. But some needlessly cruel experiments still take place: the forced swim test (FST) for example, in which a rodent is placed in a body of water it cannot escape and...",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/23/the-guardian-view-on-animal-testing-we-can-stop-sacrificing-millions-of-lives-for-our-own-health,23/11/2025
The moment I knew: he presented me with my hearing aids like they were a little gift | Marriage | The Guardian,"When Lynda Leigh and David started dating, his small, silent gesture spoke volumes about how much he cared Find more stories from the moment I knew series In 2013 I was a divorcee in my early 40s in need of some financial advice. I was living in Canberra and a friend recommended a polite, plain-speaking accountant who came to town from time to time. That’s how I met David. He was a handsome, jovial fellow with sparkling blue eyes, not quite a silver fox then, but a few years my senior. At 6 foot 3 and dressed in a smart suit and tie (a weakness of mine), he certainly made an impression. At some point between sorting out my taxes and asking where I wanted to be financially in 10 years, he noticed I was wearing hearing aids and went on to tell me what a hard time his ex-wife and stepson gave him about his hearing, and anyway, wasn’t I far too young to need them?

"Trump, war, absent media: five threats to climate progress that dogged Cop30 | Cop30 | The Guardian","Did the talks succeed or fail? The verdict must take account of the geopolitical minefield they took place in Cop30 in Belém wrapped up on Saturday night more than 24 hours later than planned, and with an Amazonian rainstorm thundering down on the conference centre. The UN structure just about held, as it has done these past three weeks despite fire, savage tropical heat and blistering political attacks on the multilateral system of global environmental governance. Dozens of agreements were gavelled through on the final day, as the most collective form of humanity worked to resolve the most complex and dangerous challenge that our species has ever faced. It was chaotic. The process very nearly collapsed and had to be rescued by last-ditch talks that went on into the early morning. Veteran observers told me the Paris agreement was on life-support. But it survived. For now at least. The outcome was not nearly enough to limit global heating to 1.5C.

How cult leader ‘Commander Butcher’ plotted to sow mayhem across US | Far right (US) | The Guardian,"Guilty plea by far-right activist lays bare plans for bombings, school shootings and Santas handing out poisoned candies Michail Chkhikvishvili, a self-described cult leader who called himself “Commander Butcher”, did not look like a Hollywood vision of a contemporary terrorist, despite the bizarre, almost made-for-TV extremist actions he planned, such as having people dressed as Santa Claus hand out poison candies on the streets of New York. Chkhikvishvili appeared in a Brooklyn court last week as one might find an office IT tech: close-cropped hair and black-rimmed glasses, attentive, clear-spoken and cooperative as he was questioned about his understanding of a plea that could see him imprisoned for up to 18 years at his March sentencing.

French winemakers ‘battle for survival’ as minister prepares for crisis talks | France | The Guardian,"Vineyard owners say sales slump, Trump tariffs and worst harvest in 70 years have put producers in danger of closure French winemakers are often accused of viewing the glass as half empty. Dire warnings about the state of the sector – one of the three pillars of the country’s economy – are a hardy perennial blamed on everything from geopolitics to a drop in the number of drinkers. Before a crisis meeting with the agriculture minister on Monday, vineyard owners say an unprecedented series of setbacks, including some of the worst harvests in 70 years, has left many of them on their last legs. Jean-Marie Fabre, the president of the independent winemakers’ syndicate, said urgent action was needed to save up to a fifth of the country’s winegrowers. “They are putting their final efforts into this battle for survival. The situation is dramatic and the government has to do something,” Fabre said. “We cannot imagine that this sector that is so important for France will be abandoned, but if the...",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/23/french-winemakers-sales-slump-crisis-talks,23/11/2025
UN warns world losing climate battle but fragile Cop30 deal keeps up the fight | Cop30 | The Guardian,"Reaching agreement in divisive political landscape shows ‘climate cooperation is alive and kicking’, says UN climate chief The world is not winning the fight against the climate crisis but it is still in that fight, the UN climate chief has said in Belém, Brazil, after a bitterly contested Cop30 reached a deal. Countries at Cop30 failed to bring the curtain down on the fossil fuel age amid opposition from some countries led by Saudi Arabia, and they underdelivered on a flagship hope – at a conference held in the Amazon – to chart an end to deforestation. But in a fractious era of nationalism, war and distrust, the talks did not collapse as was feared. Multilateralism held – just. “We knew this Cop would take place in stormy political waters,” said Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, after a long and occasionally angry final plenary at the climate summit. “Denial, division and geopolitics has dealt international cooperation some heavy blows this year.” But Cop30 showed that “climate...",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/23/un-warns-world-losing-climate-battle-but-fragile-cop30-deal-keeps-up-the-fight,23/11/2025
Has Britain become an economic colony? | Technology | The Guardian,"The UK could’ve been a true tech leader – but it has cheerfully submitted to US dominance in a way that may cost it dear Two and a half centuries ago, the American colonies launched a violent protest against British rule, triggered by parliament’s imposition of a monopoly on the sale of tea and the antics of a vainglorious king. Today, the tables have turned: it is Great Britain that finds itself at the mercy of major US tech firms – so huge and dominant that they constitute monopolies in their fields – as well as the whims of an erratic president. Yet, to the outside observer, Britain seems curiously at ease with this arrangement – at times even eager to subsidise its own economic dependence. Britain is hardly alone in submitting to the power of American firms, but it offers a clear case study in why nations need to develop a coordinated response to the rise of these hegemonic companies. The current age of American tech monopoly began in the 2000s, when the UK, like many other...",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/nov/23/has-britain-become-an-economic-colony,23/11/2025

Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, the New York City mayor-elect was asked if he still considered Trump a threat to democracy. “Everything that I’ve said in the past I continue to believe,” Mamdani replied. “I think it is important in our politics that we don’t shy away from where we have disagreements.” In his victory speech on 4 November, Mamdani said New York had demonstrated it could be the “light” in a “moment of political darkness”, taking aim at the president. “If there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power,” Mamdani said. “So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up.”...",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/mamdani-trump-fascist,23/11/2025
Brilliant Eze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thump Spurs to extend lead in title race | Premier League | The Guardian,It was an unguarded comment from an Arsenal official and it came shortly after Eberechi Eze’s mural outside the Emirates Stadium had been defaced with white paint – presumably by a Tottenham fan. It summed up the snark between the clubs and Arsenal’s delight at pipping their rivals to Eze’s signature from Crystal Palace at the end of August. “We sign a top-class forward for £60m. They throw paint at walls.” Eze’s mural has since been redone; it now has a caption to reinforce the storyline about the boyhood Arsenal fan coming back to his club after being released as a youngster. “All roads lead home.” So it did not need a joke from Thomas Frank on Friday to set up Eze v Spurs. “Who’s Eze?” the Spurs manager had said; a classic of the fate-tempting genre. It felt as though Eze was always going to have a say in this derby. It turned out that he shouted to every corner of the stadium.

The chancellor has made the decision to scrap the two-child limit in full, a move that will be welcomed by Labour MPs who have long highlighted its effect on increasing child poverty. However, the Conservatives and Reform immediately sought to portray the chancellor as presiding over a rising welfare bill at the same time as bringing in billions of pounds in tax rises for people who are working. “On Wednesday, Starmer and Reeves are going to increase your taxes to fund more welfare,” said Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party leader.

Epstein survivor condemns Trump for calling file release fight a ‘hoax’ | Donald Trump | The Guardian,"Danielle Bensky, who was abused by Jeffrey Epstein, says president was ‘incredibly disrespectful’ in recent comments A survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse has condemned Donald Trump for dismissing the victims’ fight for transparency as a “hoax”. Shortly after signing a bill to release the Epstein files, the US president posted a lengthy social media rant accusing Democrats of weaponising the scandal against him. Danielle Bensky, 39, who was abused by Epstein as a teenager, said: “[Trump] made something very political out of something that could have been really a beautiful moment for our history and for women and for survivors everywhere. “He is sort of missing the point entirely because this really should have been a day to celebrate all the achievements of all the survivors that led the charge in this.” In Trump’s rambling message on Truth Social on Wednesday night, he failed to mention Epstein’s victims and instead used the moment to attack his political opponents, saying: “This...",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/epstein-survivor-condemns-trump,23/11/2025
Wicked forever: the enduring appeal of The Wizard Of Oz | The Wizard Of Oz | The Guardian,"Musical sequel Wicked: For Good, enchanting audiences across the world, arrives as the 1939 fantasy continues to dominate pop culture Most of the biggest streaming services are notoriously neglectful of any movie released before the 1990s (and in some cases, before the turn of the millennium). Even the big theatrical nostalgia screenings are starting to creep into the 21st century, as movies that, to the older among us, don’t seem ready for a multi-decade anniversary. (Did Batman Begins really just turn 20?! Is Mean Girls seriously old enough to drink?) So it’s all the more impressive that one of the hottest properties of the past few years has been ... The Wizard of Oz, a movie far closer to its 100th anniversary than its 25th. Of course, The Wizard of Oz as (shudder) intellectual property dates well before the 1939 release of the beloved MGM musical.

Max Ojomoh delivers champagne moment for England to signify arrival on big stage | England rugby union team | The Guardian,"Versatile back’s standout performance against Argentina on his second cap should give Borthwick a valuable option It is a quirk of England’s November clean sweep that there were no debutants throughout an autumn campaign for the first time in 25 years but Max Ojomoh’s performance against Argentina when winning his second cap certainly felt like the arrival of the next big thing. For Ojomoh was the star turn of England’s least convincing performance of the autumn, finishing off the first try before teeing up the other two. His assist for Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, a delightful cross-field kick, was the champagne moment of the first half and his popped pass to Henry Slade for England’s third was equally eye-catching, rounding off a fine first outing at Twickenham for the 25-year-old. It is just eight days since Steve Borthwick might have felt that he had finally unearthed his centre partnership for the future after Fraser Dingwall and Ollie Lawrence dovetailed superbly in the victory against...",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/23/max-ojomoh-delivers-champagne-moment-for-england-to-signify-arrival-on-big-stage,23/11/2025

David Moyes says Manchester United upheaval is departure from club values | Manchester United | The Guardian,"Everton manager says United needed rebuild in 2013 Moyes goes to Old Trafford with United on good run David Moyes has said he believed Manchester United needed a long-term rebuild when he succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013 and the subsequent upheaval at Old Trafford represents a departure from the club’s values. Speaking before Monday’s return to Old Trafford with Everton, Moyes admitted his 11-month spell as United manager “didn’t work for different reasons” but insisted it has been consigned firmly to the past. However, despite inheriting a title-winning squad from Ferguson, Moyes said United’s wait for a 21st league title has come as no great surprise. “I always thought when I took the job that it wouldn’t be able to be fixed quickly,” he said. “I saw not long after I went in that it was going to take a bit of time.

The substance, synthesised by the dry distillation of bark from a birch tree, can also be used as an adhesive. After extracting DNA from the saliva, the university’s Institute of Genomics found the gum was probably chewed by a girl with brown hair and brown eyes. “The institute holds DNA samples from 20% of Estonia’s population, providing scientists with a modern genetic comparison to better interpret ancient DNA,” said the historian Bettany Hughes.

In the same way that this city of heatwaves is now being combed by chilly winds and rain, the whole thing just feels wrong. Through years of buildup, the current England team has raised the possibility of being different to those that came before.

Elaine Welteroth, then the editor-in-chief, told NPR that the day it published, Teen Vogue sold “in that month, more copies of the magazine than we had that entire year”. It was a transformative moment for the publication: proof that a magazine long associated with Disney child stars and headlines like “Prom Fever!” could shine light on the political dimensions of young people’s lives.

My cultural awakening: Chicken Run turned me vegetarian | Culture | The Guardian,"Aardman’s tale of a group of plucky hens standing up to their pie-making masters was a favourite in our house, and – I realised – incompatible with my taste for burgers By the age of 15, I was already torn between my love of animals and the deliciousness of a 99p McDonald’s Mayo Chicken. As a child I was a fussy eater, with meat and carbs being the mainstays, but as I got older I found it harder to justify eating meat. A lifelong animal lover and one of those annoying people who jokes about their “connection to animals”, I never missed an opportunity to pet a neighbourhood dog or say hello to a group of cows in a field. So, going into my teenage years, I knew that eating meat was not really compatible with my way of thinking.

European football: Jude Bellingham snatches late draw for Real Madrid at Elche | European club football | The Guardian,"Roma claim 3-1 away victory to move top of Serie A Milan take derby honours after Maignan penalty save Real Madrid were held to an entertaining 2-2 draw at Elche on Sunday after a pulsating second half in which the visitors came from behind twice with Jude Bellingham’s late goal rescuing a point. The result extended Real’s winless run to three matches in all competitions, but they reclaimed top spot in La Liga, one point ahead of Barcelona. After a lacklustre first half, Elche struck first in the 53rd minute from an impressive team move. Germán Valera’s exquisite backheel assist found Aleix Febas inside the box, and the midfielder took one touch before delicately slotting the ball past the goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Real levelled in the 81st minute through Dean Huijsen. The centre-back reacted quickest to a loose ball after a corner, slotting home from close range to bring the visitors back into the contest.

Four ways AI is being used to strengthen democracies worldwide | Nathan E Sanders and Bruce Schneier | The Guardian,"The dangers of artificial intelligence and its potential to consolidate power are clear. But used fairly, it can be a boon for good government Democracy is colliding with the technologies of artificial intelligence. Judging from the audience reaction at the recent World Forum on Democracy in Strasbourg, the general expectation is that democracy will be the worse for it. We have another narrative. Yes, there are risks to democracy from AI, but there are also opportunities. We have just published the book Rewiring Democracy: How AI will Transform Politics, Government, and Citizenship. In it, we take a clear-eyed view of how AI is undermining confidence in our information ecosystem, how the use of biased AI can harm constituents of democracies and how elected officials with authoritarian tendencies can use it to consolidate power. But we also give positive examples of how AI is transforming democratic governance and politics for the better. Here are four such stories unfolding right now...",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/23/ai-use-strengthen-democracy,23/11/2025
Trump’s former ‘drone guy’ Dan Driscoll is the unlikely point man for the Ukraine peace deal | Trump administration | The Guardian,"The army secretary has little in his résumé to suggest he can end the war between Russia and Ukraine Little in Dan Driscoll’s résumé – past or present – suggests he has the qualifications to understand the often-tortured and bloody history of relations between Russia and Ukraine. A former investment banker with a degree in business administration, the current US army secretary’s main calling card for a prominent role in the Trump administration may be a friendship with JD Vance dating from when they were at Yale Law School together. Against that thin backdrop, Driscoll now finds himself in the unlikely role of US point man between Kyiv and Moscow as Donald Trump seeks to live up to his promise to end the near four-year war between the two countries, something he once promised to do on “day one” of his presidency. Indeed, it is Driscoll’s very unfamiliarity with the underlying issues that may make him suited for a role Trump assigned him last week as a messenger between Russia’s...",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/dan-driscoll-trump-ukraine-russia-peace-deal,23/11/2025
Confident McCullum ‘planning how to bounce back’ after England’s Ashes flop | Ashes 2025-26 | The Guardian,"Coach asks fans to keep faith despite two-day defeat ‘We’ll head to Brisbane with high expectations’ Brendon McCullum has called on England fans rocked by the team’s calamitous two-day defeat by Australia in the first Ashes Test to “keep the faith”, insisting the team’s only chance of turning the series around was to double down on their methods. “You’ve got to block out the doubts and the insecurities that can creep in,” said the head coach, “because if that does happen then you literally have no chance.” The speed at which the game unravelled has left the team with some unexpected time off – though a few of those who were not required at Perth Stadium spent their Sunday playing for the Lions against an Australia XI at Lilac Hill – with management now deciding whether the best preparation for the second Test, which starts in Brisbane on 4 December, will involve sending some squad members to play in the Lions’ next fixture, a day-nighter against a Prime Minister’s XI in Canberra, or...",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/23/brendon-mccullum-england-ashes-brisbane,23/11/2025
‘He was just trying to earn a few kopecks’: how newly translated stories reveal Chekhov’s silly side | Anton Chekhov | The Guardian,"With daft jokes and experimental wordplay, the first comprehensive translations of his lesser-known stories show Anton Chekhov in a new light Few writers are as universally admired as Chekhov. As Booker winner George Saunders puts it, “Chekhov – shall I be blunt? – is the greatest short story writer who ever lived.” Novelists from Ann Patchett to Zadie Smith cite him as an inspiration. His plays The Seagull, Three Sisters, Uncle Vanya and The Cherry Orchard still pack out theatres internationally. In the past year alone, Andrew Scott wowed audiences in his one-man Vanya for London’s National Theatre and Cate Blanchett took on the role of Arkadina in The Seagull at the Barbican. But how much did you know about his silly side?

The University of Virginia and Cornell deals with Trump set a dangerous precedent | Serena Mayeri and Amanda Shanor | The Guardian,"The bespoke agreements are full of peril for the universities, allowing the federal government to quietly exert control In October, President Trump proposed a compact for higher education, a federal takeover of state and private institutions thinly disguised as an offer of preferential funding consideration. Most of the initially targeted universities rightfully have rejected Trump’s unlawful and unconstitutional compact, but some schools, including the University of Virginia and Cornell, have since signed separate agreements with the federal government. Initial media coverage largely portrayed the deals as compromises that allowed the universities to preserve institutional autonomy and resolve outstanding federal investigations.

He also said any plan “requires broader consultation” and had to allow for peace for Ukrainians and “security for all Europeans”.

How ambitious ‘forest city’ plan for England could become a reality | Green building | The Guardian,"Cross-party coalition behind proposals hope eco-friendly scheme for million people could begin before end of decade In the next few years, spades could be in the ground for a city made of wood, in the middle of the largest new nature reserve created in England in decades, with four-bedroom homes on sale for £350,000. It sounds too good to be true, but a cross-party coalition of campaigners is trying to make a “forest city” to house a million people a reality, with construction commencing by the end of this parliament. It would be the first such project in England since the purpose-built new town of Milton Keynes in the 1960s.

South Africa presented the two-day event as a triumph for multilateralism but it was marred by a boycott by the US, which has repeatedly accused South Africa of discriminating against white-minority Afrikaners, a claim that has been widely discredited.

US senator slams Republicans’ silence on Trump’s violent threats to Democrats | US politics | The Guardian,"Mark Kelly, a veteran and Democrat targeted by Trump over military comments, says he is ‘not going to be intimidated’ Senator Mark Kelly on Sunday urged congressional Republicans to publicly reject Trump’s threats against him and five other Democratic lawmakers who stated that military personnel are not obligated to follow illegal commands. “We’ve heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the president has said about hanging members of Congress,” Kelly, of Arizona, said on CBS’s Face the Nation. Kelly noted that both Donald Trump and Republican legislators had previously asked Democrats to moderate their language after the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September, asking: “What happened to that?” “His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,” Kelly said of Trump’s...",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/senator-mark-kelly-trump-threats-democrats-congress-military,23/11/2025
Meet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI | Artificial intelligence (AI) | The Guardian,"When the people making AI seem trustworthy are the ones who trust it the least, it shows that incentives for speed are overtaking safety, experts say Krista Pawloski remembers the single defining moment that shaped her opinion on the ethics of artificial intelligence.

‘Eating Indigenously’: award-winning chef celebrates Native American cuisine in new cookbook | Native Americans | The Guardian,"James Beard-winning chef Sean Sherman’s cookbook Turtle Island pushes readers to view food systems through an Indigenous lens As a child growing up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in the 1970s and 80s, Sean Sherman, an Oglala Lakota member and a James Beard award-winning chef, recalls pounding dried bison and mixing it with chokeberry to create a snack called wasná. He and his cousins would often hunt for pheasants and grouse, or harvest wild berries and Thíŋpsiŋla, a wild prairie turnip that’s a staple Lakota food. Sherman’s earliest memories of food were full of history, culture and spiritualism. His idealistic experiences of harvesting and hunting for food on the reservation were juxtaposed with the legacy of colonialism. Most of the time, Sherman and his family ate government-issued food such as canned beef, or blocks of cow cheese, which diverged from their traditional diet.

But more than four hours after the race had concluded, the Dutchman found himself catapulted right back into the fight as the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were disqualified. Norris had finished second and Piastri fourth, solid enough results to maintain an advantage over Verstappen, but two hours after the race the governing body, the FIA, announced it was investigating the wear on the skid blocks on their cars.

The result was high and he subsequently had a biopsy that revealed the cancer. Lord Cameron, 59, told the Times: “You always hope for the best.

The warning comes from the Runnymede Trust and 50 other groups demanding that the policy in England and Wales is scrapped, in a letter sent to the home secretary and police chiefs on Friday. Their research shows that the policy introduced in August led to the term “asylum seeker” appearing in articles on serious crime five times more than before the policy change.

This is how we do it: ‘I’ll have to tell my wife what’s going on soon’ | Life and style | The Guardian,"Andy, who is in a sexless marriage, has become besotted with Rita – and their sexual chemistry is incredible. But how long can they go on like this? How do you do it? Share the story of your sex life, anonymously What makes the sex incredible is our chemistry, and the complete lack of judgment and pressure When I met Rita through a ramblers’ club 18 months ago, I was instantly fascinated by her, and the more that we flirted at group meet-ups, the more intrigued I became. Still, I waited months to initiate anything – making up some pretext to pop over, then asking permission to kiss her. She agreed, but she said she needed more time to think before taking things any further, which of course I understood – though I was dying to sleep with her.

Murder Inc: how my failed attempt to make a Zodiac Killer film took me to the dark heart of the true crime industry | Documentary | The Guardian,"When my quest to make a cliche-free film about one of America’s most notorious cold cases fell apart, I ended up investigating something entirely different – our own morbid curiosity If you think true crime is inescapable when you’re browsing Netflix or making small talk with your co-workers, try working in the documentary industry. As you traipse from one commissioning meeting to the next, pitching your passion project on the history of mime or the secret life of snails, you can almost hear the words before they’re spoken: “Got any other ideas?” Preferably something with a body count. I had just begun making documentaries in 2015, when the double whammy of HBO’s The Jinx and Netflix’s Making a Murderer brought true crime back to the dead centre of popular culture. Positioned as social justice projects as much as murder mysteries, those shows seemed to herald a new beginning for the genre.

That’s what it was like to be part of Cop30 in Brazil. And yet more than 190 countries came together in the rainforest of the Amazon and reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism, the Paris agreement and the need to redouble our efforts to keep global warming to 1.5C. We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life.

England must avoid Perth 2025 becoming the new Adelaide 2006 | Ashes 2025-26 | The Guardian,"Losing the first Test to Australia by eight wickets after being 105 ahead with one man out could derail the entire tour Stuart Broad was a highly meme-able cricketer and it turns out that talent now extends into commentary. As Joe Root chopped Mitchell Starc on to his stumps during England’s subsidence on Saturday afternoon, Broad summed up the mood of a nation without uttering so much as a word. In a clip that has since gone viral, Broad is in the Channel 7 box with his eyes shut, arms folded, letting out an exasperated sigh; the kind of internal “FFS” triggered by a toddler doing the very thing they were just warned against. Watching from the far end as two teammates fall to expansive drives on a bouncy, nippy surface, only to attempt a repeat against Starc, is a bit like pulling on the cat’s tail. Root did it anyway.

Why Trump’s lavish Saudi courtship leaves Israel on the back foot | US foreign policy | The Guardian,"Pageantry and trillion-dollar promises reveal how Washington’s loyalties may be tilting toward the Gulf The White House welcome bestowed on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was the most lavish of the Trump presidency, and a gaudily clear statement of its foreign policy priorities. It was billed as a mere working visit, but it was more extravagant than any previous state visit. The president greeted the prince on the south lawn, the White House’s biggest stage. There were uniformed men on horses bearing flags and a flypast of fighter jets. Once inside the newly gilded Oval Office, Trump came across as a man besotted. He grabbed at the prince’s hand and declared more than once what an honour it was to lay claim to the royal friendship. When a journalist pierced this golden bubble by raising the 2018 murder and dismemberment of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi – the main reason Prince Mohammed had not visited for seven years – Trump lashed out, lambasting the...",https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/23/trump-lavish-saudi-courtship-leaves-israel-on-backfoot,23/11/2025
‘That doesn’t exist’: Doge reportedly quietly disbanded ahead of schedule | Trump administration | The Guardian,"Statement by Trump administration confirms longstanding suspicions that Musk-led agency is on its way out The “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has apparently been dissolved with eight months still remaining on its contract, ending a drawn-out campaign of invading federal agencies and firing thousands of federal workers. “That doesn’t exist,” office of personnel management (OPM) director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month when asked about Doge’s status, adding that it was no longer a “centralized entity”. The statement confirmed longstanding suspicions that Doge, created by an executive order that Donald Trump signed on his first day, was on its way out.

The race was won by the Red Bull driver but Norris took a strong second and Piastri fourth. However, four hours after the race and following an investigation by the FIA, both were disqualified after the skid blocks on the floor of their cars were found to have been worn down below the 9mm limit defined in the rules. “We apologise to Lando and Oscar for the loss of points today, at a critical time in their championship campaigns after two strong performances from them all weekend,” said McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella. “As a team, we...",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/23/mclarens-lando-norris-and-oscar-piastri-disqualified-from-las-vegas-gp,23/11/2025
Safe haven to sanctions: how Jersey sheltered Roman Abramovich’s billions | Roman Abramovich | The Guardian,"Court papers show the island cautiously welcomed the oligarch – with London’s approval – before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine For decades the Channel Islands tax haven of Jersey has played a big role in moving fortunes made in some of the world’s most despotic countries into the west, attracting overseas oligarchs with a mix of low tax and high levels of financial secrecy. It is a secrecy that extends to Jersey’s relationship with the UK government. As a crown dependency, Jersey has its own parliament, but belongs to the king. The relationship between the two jurisdictions remains something of a black box, with very little public information on how the big decisions are made, or to what extent Westminster is consulted. That changed last week, when Jersey itself released the details of a two-year legal battle with Roman Abramovich, the Russian billionaire and former Chelsea football club proprietor.

Contepomi accuses ‘bully’ Curry of reckless tackle and shoving Argentina coach | England rugby union team | The Guardian,"Tackle forces Mallía off with suspected serious injury Borthwick insists England forward is ‘respectful guy’ Tom Curry found himself at the centre of a storm after England’s win against Argentina, as Felipe Contepomi accused the flanker not only of a “reckless” tackle on Juan Cruz Mallía but of shoving him, the Pumas’ coach, in the tunnel afterwards. Mallía, the full-back, was forced off late on with what is thought to be an anterior cruciate ligament injury, which meant Argentina, who had used all their replacements, had to finish the match with 14 men. “How old is he?” said Contepomi of Curry. “Twenty-seven? And strong. And I am 48 and he comes and just [shoves me]. I was standing there. He was coming in to say hi to one of our coaches, but we said no because we were upset.

Fluffy and fabulous! 17 ways with marshmallows – from cheesecake to salad to an espresso martini | Food | The Guardian,"They come into their own around Thanksgiving in the US, used alongside savoury dishes, as well as in desserts. Now is the time to try them with sweet potatoes, in a strawberry mousse, or even with soup The connection between marsh mallow the herbaceous perennial, also known as althaea officinalis, and marshmallow the puffy cylindrical sweet, is historic. In the 19th century, the sap of the plant was still a key ingredient of its confectionary namesake, along with sugar and egg whites. But that connection has long been severed: the modern industrial marshmallow is derived from a mixture of sugar, water and gelatine. Its main ingredient is air. But there’s a lot you can do with the humble marshmallow – here are 17 examples. By all accounts, a homemade marshmallow is infinitely preferable to the store-bought version, although it’s also a necessary compromise – you can’t hope to replicate the exact texture of the machine-made product.

China has brought millions out of poverty. The US has not – by choice | US income inequality | The Guardian,"Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But this is no glitch – it’s the system The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4 million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago. The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that much further ahead.

Who can tame Trump?

Congress won’t do it – Republicans slavishly follow his orders, Democrats are ill-led and divided. For today’s White House, the concept of constitutional limits on executive power is a quaint relic. The news media, or sections of it, does its best amid constant legal threats. But, too often, they pay him off. Brave reporters who insist on asking awkward questions are insulted or silenced: “Quiet, piggy.” So who will tame Donald Trump?

"Compromises, voluntary measures and no mention of fossil fuels: key points from Cop30 deal | Cop30 | The Guardian","A deal is welcome after talks nearly collapsed but the final agreement contains small steps rather than leaps The UN climate summit Cop30 moved forward the fight against the climate crisis and the damage it is already causing to lives and livelihoods. But the measures agreed are steps, rather than the leaps needed. The negotiations between more than 190 countries came close to collapse, as ambitious countries and petrostates threatened to block any deal or walk out. But global heating requires a global response and in today’s fractured geopolitical climate sealing a deal backed by all countries keeps the UN climate show on the road. “At a time of great political challenge, 194 countries have come together within the Paris agreement to recommit to acting on the climate crisis,” said the UK energy secretary, Ed Miliband. “This agreement does not have all the ambition we would have wanted but it commits to keeping 1.5C alive.” The US did not send a delegation – Donald Trump has dismissed...",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/22/roadmaps-adaptations-and-transitions-what-climate-measures-were-agreed-at-cop30,22/11/2025
Van der Merwe becomes Scotland’s record try-scorer in thrashing of Tonga | Autumn Nations Series | The Guardian,"Visitors given three yellow cards and one red Duhan van der Merwe moved in front of Darcy Graham at the top of Scotland’s all-time try-scoring charts as Gregor Townsend’s side rounded off a disappointing autumn with an eight-try 56-0 win over indisciplined Tonga at Murrayfield. The Scots’ series was always going to be defined by results against New Zealand and Argentina, so back-to-back losses in those two Tests meant the visit of a Tonga side ranked 19th in the world would be largely irrelevant in the final analysis – unless Townsend’s men were beaten again. That scenario never looked likely once the hosts – with 14 changes from the side that started against the Pumas a week earlier – eased into a 21-0 interval lead through converted tries from the forwards Jamie Ritchie, George Turner and Max Williamson, all scored at a time when Semisi Paea was serving a 20-minute red card.

The change comes after years of advocacy from gynecologists, patients and professional medical organizations.

"UPS, FedEx scramble to shore up networks drained by deadly crash - The Business Times","The grounding has drained capacity and complicated operations for the world’s largest package delivery companies just as shipping volumes surge for the peak period to Christmas [NEW YORK] United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx are working to secure enough freighters as they grapple with a ban on a pillar of their air-cargo fleets through the crucial holiday delivery season, and potentially beyond. An indefinite grounding of the workhorse MD-11 jet is in place as investigators probe why an engine tore off a 34-year-old widebody just as it took off on Nov 4. The resulting crash killed 14 people.

Snap starts checking users ages before Australian under-16 ban - The Business Times,"SNAP will start checking many users’ ages in Australia as it prepares for a world-first social media ban for under-16s next month. Snapchat account holders will be able to verify their age through a connection to an Australian bank account, with government-issued identification, or by taking a selfie to enable facial-age estimation, Snap said. The law aims to shield children from online abuse and other toxic elements of social media, and under-16s won’t be allowed to hold accounts or open a new one from Dec 10. Meta Platforms, owner of Facebook and Instagram, said last week it will start removing underage accounts from Dec 4.

Crypto crash is eroding wealth for Trump’s family and followers - The Business Times,"Bitcoin has endured multiple steep plunges before, only to climb higher and higher with time [NEW YORK] In US President Donald Trump’s second term, crypto assets transformed his family’s wealth. Now the Trumps – and their followers – are getting a crash course in the wild volatility ingrained in digital currencies. The value of a Trump-branded memecoin has fallen by about a quarter since August. Eric Trump’s stake in a Bitcoin mining venture has shed roughly half its value from its peak. Shares of Trump’s social media company, which started hoarding Bitcoin this year, are hovering near an all-time low. The sell-off is part of a broader rout that’s wiped out more than US$1 trillion of value across the digital asset world.

Will 2026 see showdown between big game and indie publishers? - The Business Times,"Smaller competitors have shone this year while heavyweights are down but not out [SINGAPORE] The Game Awards, a glitzy annual event celebrating the industry’s best, announced on Nov 17 the six games nominated for its prestigious Game of the Year award. The big surprise? Only three of them were from major publishers such as Sony and Nintendo. No nominee list has ever included so many indie titles – each year typically has one at most. Two of the indie titles, Hades II and Hollow Knight: Silksong, were self-published while frontrunner Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was published by Kepler Interactive, which is co-owned and run by a group of game developers (it also has an operations hub in Singapore). Based on various estimates, it is likely none of these smaller titles had a budget exceeding US$30 million, while major, or AAA, games typically have budgets closer to US$100 million or more.

Gold’s volatility and the limits of safety - The Business Times,"The precious metal’s swing from simple hedge to strategic asset is being tested amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic shifts GOLD’S spectacular rally in 2025 has entered a more volatile phase. After topping US$4,380 an ounce and gaining more than 50 per cent for the year, the metal’s price fell sharply in late October, but recently steadied near the $US4,050 level. The correction underscores what many investors suspected: even a structural bull market can stumble when sentiment overshoots. The question is no longer simply why gold has risen, but whether its new-found prominence as a portfolio cornerstone can withstand stress. For investors, this latest swing is a reminder that gold’s evolution from hedge to strategic signal is a story still being written.

Fund managers noted that the segment has historically suffered from thin liquidity, limited analyst coverage and muted investor interest, leaving valuations depressed. “Low valuations and thin liquidity, especially beyond large-cap names, discouraged quality listings and shareholder-friendly moves,” said Eleanor Seet, president and head of Asia ex-Japan at Amova Asset Management, referring to the low interest as a “negative loop”.

Nasdaq 100 rally shows signs of stalling - The Business Times,"SINCE early November, the Nasdaq 100 index has seen a notable pullback of around 6 per cent as at the time of writing last week, driven primarily by anxiety surrounding the artificial intelligence (AI) trade and a recalibration of Fed rate cut expectations. Names in the AI trade were a source of recent pressure, with a steady stream of negative headlines stoking fears of a bubble in the sector. Famed short-seller Michael Burry roiled the market with recent regulatory filings disclosing his fresh wagers against AI favourites Nvidia and Palantir, with purchases of put options in the third quarter. In addition, he accused the “hyperscalers”, which are the major cloud and AI infrastructure providers, of employing aggressive accounting to understate depreciation expenses to artificially pad their earnings growth.

Revenue rose 16 per cent to S$837.4 million, from S$723.1 million in the year before. This was primarily driven by stronger project offtake in the second half, BRC Asia said on Sunday (Nov 23). “The growth was partially offset by lower selling prices due to falling steel prices during the period.” For the full year, net profit stood at S$94.3 million, 1 per cent higher than the S$93.5 million in the financial year ended Sep 30, 2024.

"Address concerns over AI’s impact on jobs and livelihoods, and help workers adjust: PM Lawrence Wong - The Business Times","[JOHANNESBURG] Amid all the innovation brought about by artificial intelligence (AI), a key challenge for governments everywhere is to address concerns about jobs and livelihoods, and help workers adjust, said Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Sunday (Nov 23). AI is evolving rapidly, with tremendous potential to improve and transform lives, he pointed out, and the world is still in the early stages of the AI journey, one marked by great excitement and massive investments.

Kering CEO plans ‘House of Dreams’ investment arm to help trim reliance on Gucci - The Business Times,"The move gives the unit long-term capital to back emerging brands as shoppers shift away from traditional luxury [PARIS/MILAN] Kering’s new CEO Luca De Meo plans to set up a new unit to scout for up-and-coming brands to invest in, documents seen by Reuters show, as he seeks to tap new revenue streams and trim the group’s reliance on struggling Gucci. The move would see the unit, named “House of Dreams”, given long-term capital to take stakes in or partner with emerging businesses, as wealthy shoppers have increasingly turned their backs on traditional luxury brands. The plan, shared in a memo with senior staff in October and previously unreported, gives insight into de Meo’s wider strategy to revamp the US$20 billion luxury conglomerate ahead of a much-awaited investor presentation next spring.

Investors eye holiday season turbulence amid AI and rate cut doubts - The Business Times,"A crucial uncertainty set to dog markets in coming days is whether the Fed will cut rates at its Dec 9 to Dec 10 meeting [NEW YORK] Stock market investors are preparing for a turbulent year-end sparked by uncertainty over near-term Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and mounting worries that artificial intelligence companies, which have propelled the market to new records this year, are overvalued. The market continued to slide this past week, despite equity indexes rebounding sharply on Friday (Nov 21). As of Friday’s close, the benchmark S&P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite were down 4 per cent and 7 per cent respectively from their late October record highs.

Bloomberg News reported on Sunday (Nov 23) that the world’s largest miner, which made a failed bid for Anglo last year, had made a fresh overture in recent days. Anglo rejected the offer, according to sources familiar with the situation, having reviewed the proposal and decided that it is not superior to a planned combination with Canada’s Teck Resources.

China’s Premier Li Qiang launches charm offensive on rare earths at G20 - The Business Times,"European nations have been hit hard by the Asian nation’s decision to require export licenses for metals with military purposes CHINA’S Premier Li Qiang came to the Group of 20 (G20) summit not only poised to defend his country’s rare earths curbs, but also armed with offerings to quell concerns of developing nations. Critical minerals became a defining theme of Africa’s first G20 summit this weekend. Sessions were dedicated to the topic as European leaders grappled with supply chain issues and Global South countries appealed for help in benefiting from a burgeoning industry where Beijing dominates processing. Li had responses to both problems. In a speech on Sunday (Nov 23), he justified the need to “cautiously manage” exports of minerals critical for military use, laying out China’s rationale for its sweeping curbs.

Why a wealth manager started a portfolio for his 6-month-old - The Business Times,"If you’ve ever stared at a childcare invoice and wondered if investing is now a form of self-defence, you’re not alone. The sandwich generation is juggling ageing parents, overstimulated children and the ever-rising cost of simply existing. It’s relentless, it’s expensive, and it’s exactly why conversations like this matter. In this week’s Money Hacks by The Business Times, Howie Lim sits down with Timothy Liew, head of investments (Wealth Management) at OCBC, and a parent who has weathered both market volatility and toddler meltdowns. His first brush with “investing” was a spectacularly misguided leveraged FX punt at university. $5,000 gone, and several painful lessons acquired early. Today he’s far more level-headed, thoughtful about risk, and refreshingly open about what regular working adults actually need to hear. The heart of this episode is Liew’s candour.

Nvidia didn’t save the market.

They didn’t. So where does the AI trade stand now? It depends who you ask. On one side, you have the sceptics. They are concerned about soaring market valuations as investors chase growth in a small collection of stocks tied to the AI boom. They see the hundreds of billions of US dollars these companies are spending to stay in the race as unsustainable, particularly as they start to take on debt in order to keep up. In addition, the circular nature of these financing arrangements creates a potential systemic risk in which one company’s weakness can bring down the entire trade.

No recession risk for US economy as a whole after US$11 billion shutdown hit: Bessent - The Business Times,"Bessent struck an upbeat tone, despite recent data showing a slowdown in US factory activity [WASHINGTON] Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said the 43-day government shutdown caused an US$11 billion permanent hit to the US economy, but he was optimistic about growth prospects next year given easing interest rates and tax cuts. Bessent told NBC’s Meet the Press programme that parts of the US economy that are sensitive to interest rates, including housing, had been in recession, but he did not see the entire economy at risk of negative growth. He blamed the services economy, not US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, for inflation - repeating the Trump administration’s longstanding take - and added that he expected lower energy prices to drive down prices more broadly.

Why AI isn’t booking your flights – yet - The Business Times,"You don’t trust it, but that’s not all FOR an industry that prides itself on innovation, commercial aviation’s digital interfaces have changed remarkably little. Whether you’re booking a S$15,000 first-class fare from Singapore to London or a S$70 low-cost hop to Bali, the process looks strikingly similar to what it did in 1998. The Internet Booking Engine remains frozen in time, merely refreshed by better visuals and faster search results. Step one: enter departure and arrival airports. Step two: pick your dates. Step 3: select passengers, then scroll through flight options, fares, ancillaries, passenger details, and finally payment. Three decades on, we’ve seen stunning leaps in digital capability: self-driving taxis on public roads, artificial intelligence (AI) co-pilots in corporate offices, and personalised retail ecosystems that can anticipate your next purchase.

"Investing? Look beyond S&P 500, says The Library of Mistakes’ founder - The Business Times","BT exclusive: The concept dedicated to the study of financial history comes to Singapore in 2027 [SINGAPORE] In the 1820s, more than 200 people sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from England and Scotland to a supposedly thriving new country – Poyais, near Honduras. But this was nothing more than an investment scheme hatched by a Scottish soldier named Gregor MacGregor, who had led several military campaigns in the South American region. He sold worthless Poyaisian currency and bonds – in exchange for sterling – to these people, promising them a vibrant port, fertile land and prosperity.

"More than 6 in 10 retail investors in Singapore hold crypto, but allocation size conservative: survey - The Business Times","44% view crypto as an asset; almost one-third deem it a speculative tool [SIINGAPORE] Sixty-one per cent of retail investors in Singapore own cryptocurrency, but crypto allocation remains low, as crypto makes up less than 10 per cent of most portfolios. These findings were reported by SingSaver and Coinbase’s first ever joint report, Pulse of Crypto Survey, which surveyed 3,513 active retail investors and members of the ""wider crypto-curious public"" in Singapore in August this year. Their report noted that 74 per cent of crypto holders allocate less than 10 per cent of their assets in crypto. Less than one in 10 surveyed (8 per cent) held more than 25 per cent of their assets in crypto. Their report also noted that the median portfolio size of investors is between S$3,000 and S$5,000, and an average crypto holder owns three different cryptocurrencies.

Nvidia didn’t save the market. What’s next for the AI trade? - The Business Times,"An index of chip-related stocks is down 11% in November and on pace for its worst month since 2022 [CHICAGO] Wall Street thought blowout earnings from Nvidia would calm investors’ nerves about a bubble forming in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. They didn’t. So where does the AI trade stand now? It depends who you ask. On one side, you have the sceptics. They are concerned about soaring market valuations as investors chase growth in a small collection of stocks tied to the AI boom. They see the hundreds of billions of US dollars these companies are spending to stay in the race as unsustainable, particularly as they start to take on debt in order to keep up. In addition, the circular nature of these financing arrangements creates a potential systemic risk in which one company’s weakness can bring down the entire trade. The other side are the optimists, who see the recent pullback in AI-related shares as a healthy correction on the way to further growth.

4 ways to cut back on salt without losing flavour or satisfaction - CNA Lifestyle,"Using sour ingredients, potassium salt, and umami-rich seasonings can deepen flavour without added sodium, experts suggest. (Photo: The New York Times) Salt is magical: It can reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and enhance overall flavor. But 90 per cent of people in the United States eat too much of it. The US dietary guidelines recommend that adults consume no more than 2,300mg of sodium each day, but the average American consumes 3,400mg, increasing their risk of heart disease, strokes, kidney issues and death. The good news is that you can retrain your palate to crave less salt, but many people don’t know where to begin. So we asked experts for their best tips and tricks. In general, taste follows two flavor-sensing pathways: One for sour and salty and another for sweet, bitter and umami.

Pollution been an issue for so long in the Indian capital that the city’s famous Red Fort is turning black, an outward sign of a growing health and political crisis that’s now bringing angry residents onto the streets. “I just want to be able to breathe again,” said Sofie, 33, at a protest near Delhi’s India Gate earlier this month. “There seems to be no political will to fix the issue,” she added, surrounded by dozens of protesters wearing face masks and carrying nebulizers. Successive Delhi governments have had air pollution plans dating back to 1996, but decades on, the air remains dangerously unhealthy, especially at this time of year when colder air traps smoke and fumes from fireworks, crop-burning and heavy city traffic.

Fifty students escape captors after mass kidnapping in Nigeria but more than 250 still held - Yahoo News Singapore,"Fifty students who were abducted from a Catholic school in northern Nigeria on Friday have returned to their families after they managed to escape, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said on Sunday. Armed bandits kidnapped 303 children and 12 teachers from the St. Mary’s Private Catholic school in the country’s north-central Niger State on Friday, according to CAN. The students are both male and female, some as young as ten. “The pupils escaped between Friday and Saturday and have reunited with their parents as they could not return to the school after they escaped,” spokesman for CAN’s Niger State chapter chairman Most.

Germany wants to build Europe’s strongest army – a new conscription bill is moving that closer - Yahoo News Singapore,"This year, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz pledged to build Europe’s strongest army – a tall order for a country whose military has undergone years of neglect. The coalition government is hoping a new bill agreed upon last week will help make this a reality, bolstering Germany’s forces in the face of the perceived threat from Russia and a significant shift in US foreign policy. The sweeping new reforms will see Germany attempt to boost its numbers to 260,000 soldiers, up from around 180,000 currently, in addition to an extra 200,000 reservists, by 2035. In the first instance, the drive will focus on voluntary enlistment, with greater incentives for those who sign up, including a monthly starting salary of €2,600 ($3,000) – an increase of €450 from the current level. If the new quotas are not met, the government will have the option of mandatory call-ups, where necessary. From next year, all 18-year-olds will receive a questionnaire about their interest in serving.

Zohran Mamdani Stands By Calling Trump A Fascist After Rosy White House Meeting - Yahoo News Singapore,"New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani stood his ground on Sunday in calling Donald Trump a fascist, just days after a shockingly chummy meeting at the White House that ended in some policy agreements and unexpected praise by the president for the leftist leader whose candidacy he previously condemned. Mamdani did not shy away from calling the president a fascist during his mayoral campaign, and doubled down during Friday’s meeting when a reporter asked if he still stands by that statement. Politics: Trump Makes Surprising U-Turn On Plans To Deploy National Guard To New York City Trump interjected before Mamdani could answer, saying: “That’s OK, you can just say yes. It’s easier than explaining it, I don’t mind.” “OK, yes,” the mayor-elect said with a smile as Trump patted his arm. On Sunday, Mamdani was asked again if he still thinks Trump is a fascist. “That’s something that I’ve said in the past.

Brazil's Bolsonaro detained for trying to break ankle bracelet and flee - Yahoo News Singapore,"Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro -- under house arrest while he appeals a conviction for a foiled coup attempt -- was taken into custody Saturday after the Supreme Court deemed him a high flight risk. The court said the far-right firebrand -- who was sentenced to 27 years in prison over a scheme to stop leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 elections -- had attempted to disable his ankle monitor in order to flee. Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes said Bolsonaro's detention was a preventive measure as final appeals play out. In a video made public by the court, Bolsonaro admitted that he had used a soldering iron on the monitoring bracelet out of ""curiosity."" The video showed the device badly damaged and burned, but still on his ankle. The 70-year-old Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil from 2019 to 2022, was placed under house arrest in August and has been confined to an upscale condominium in the capital Brasilia.

Justice Department again asks judge to unseal Epstein grand jury testimony after Congress passes law - Yahoo News Singapore,"The Justice Department has asked a federal judge in Florida to reconsider unsealing grand jury materials related to an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, as the agency faces a congressionally-mandated deadline to release all documents related to the accused sex trafficker next month. A judge in the Southern District of Florida previously denied a request by the DOJ to make public transcripts from the case, which federal prosecutors asked for due to “extensive public interest” but not as part of a judicial proceeding. Epstein committed many of his crimes in Florida. When a Florida judge denied the DOJ’s original request, she said her “hands are tied” because the Justice Department sought to release the sealed evidence due to “extensive public interest,” not as part of a judicial proceeding, which is the usual standard.

US economy – and seaweed – slow tourist flow to Mexico’s Caribbean resort town - Yahoo News Singapore,"Armed with shovels and wheelbarrows, municipal workers from Tulum, Mexico, were deployed to the resort town’s famed beaches in June, tasked with removing large quantities of sargassum that had piled up to cover the crystal-clear waters. By that point in the year, authorities said they had collected 1,900 tons of the pesky seaweed, more than the 1,300 tons collected in all of 2024. Local officials and hotel owners have told CNN that the amount of sargassum this year is the largest they’ve seen since 2018 – an issue that has contributed to a lower flow of visitors this year. But the seaweed isn’t the only problem facing Tulum, a town in Yucatán Peninsula renowned for its idyllic coastlines and archaeological wonders. Other factors, such as the shaky US economy, local insecurity and the management of beaches, are also impacting tourism at this Caribbean destination, a favorite among Americans.

"Zoo vaccination efforts don’t target every animal, but focus on rare, disease-prone species: Experts - Yahoo News Singapore","SINGAPORE - Animal vaccines have for centuries been used in farms to prevent diseases from spreading among livestock, but this tool is increasingly being used for another purpose: to safeguard endangered species from succumbing to infectious diseases. This comes as climate change and globalisation accelerate the spread of pathogens around the world, with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) detected even among the penguins and seabirds on the uninhabited Antarctic region. On Nov 19, Singapore announced that it will be conducting a pilot to vaccinate against HPAI potentially up to 10 species of birds across the wildlife parks managed by the Mandai Wildlife Reserve, starting from 2026.

What does US 'terrorist' designation for Venezuela mean? - Yahoo News Singapore,"Washington's designation of an alleged Venezuelan cartel as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) takes effect on Monday, opening the door to new forms of US pressure on President Nicolas Maduro. The FTO list, which includes Islamist groups, separatists, guerrillas, and more recently, gangs and drug organizations from Mexico and Colombia, is overseen by the State Department. From Monday, the list will include ""Cartel de los Soles"" (""Cartel of the Suns""), which Washington claims is run by Maduro. The shadowy group is responsible for ""terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. The move is part of the Trump administration's campaign against drugs and illegal immigration from Latin America. No evidence has been made public to support the accusation of Maduro's involvement in the group.

Why illegal gold mining is overtaking cocaine as the drug of choice for traffickers in Latin America - Yahoo News Singapore,"The Trump administration’s drone strikes against boats allegedly bringing illicit drugs to the US come amid an explosion in the amount of cocaine being produced in Colombia and Peru. But there is a new – and lethal – factor that is turbo-charging production – especially in Peru: the relationship between coca cultivation and illicit gold mining. It’s a toxic combination that is enriching criminal gangs and corrupt officials, as the price of gold touches new highs on world markets. And it’s taking root in other states – including Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela. In July, Peru’s then foreign minister Elmer Schialer said the illegal gold economy in Peru was seven times bigger than the cocaine trade. Colombia has traditionally been the epicenter of coca cultivation in South America. But cocaine production has spiked in Peru, where more than 800 tons were produced last year according to the US State Department.

Trump Grumbles Over 'Inherited' Russia-Ukraine War In Heated Post - Yahoo News Singapore,"President Donald Trump accused Ukraine yet again of being ungrateful for his efforts to end Russia’s war on the country as top Ukrainian, U.S. and European officials gathered in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday to discuss the U.S. peace proposal to put an end to the war. In a heated Truth Social post Sunday, the president, who has championed the 28-point plan, criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top U.S. allies in Europe, arguing that “with strong and proper U.S. and Ukrainian LEADERSHIP,” the “violent and terrible” war wouldn’t have happened.

Slovenia referendum rejects contested assisted dying law - Yahoo News Singapore,"Slovenians on Sunday voted to suspend a new law to legalise assisted dying in a referendum held after critics mounted a campaign against the legislation. Around 53 percent of voters had rejected the law, while 47 percent voted in favour, meaning its implementation will be suspended for at least one year. Slovenia's parliament had approved a law in July allowing assisted dying after a 2024 referendum supported it. But the new vote was called after a civil group, backed by the Catholic Church and the conservative parliamentary opposition, gathered 46,000 signatures in favour of a repeat, exceeding the 40,000 required. The result means parliament cannot vote again on a bill that deals with the same issue over the next 12 months. Ales Primc, the head of Voice for the Children and the Family, the NGO that organised the no vote campaign, reacted to the results saying ""solidarity and justice"" had won.

Morgan Geyser, 23, was last seen in a residential neighborhood in the west side of Madison, Wisconsin, around 8 p.m. Saturday with an adult acquaintance, and it is not known where she is, police said in a statement. In a crime that stunned the nation, Geyser and her friend Anissa Weier, both 12 at the time of the crime, lured their classmate into a park in Waukesha, Wisconsin, in 2014, where they stabbed her 19 times to impress Slender Man, a boogeyman for the internet age. The victim, Peyton Leutner, was also 12 at the time and survived, crawling out of the woods to safety where she was discovered by a passing bicyclist.

These Democrats helped flip the House in Trump’s first term. They’re coming back to try to do it again - Yahoo News Singapore,"Seven years ago, they were part of a wave of first-time candidates who helped Democrats retake the US House. But their tenures in Congress were brief. Ben McAdams of Utah lost his first re-election bid in 2020. Two years later, Tom Malinowski of New Jersey and Elaine Luria of Virginia were defeated by Republican opponents as the GOP retook control of the House. Now, the former lawmakers are launching comebacks, running on both affordability issues and the public service and democracy-focused messaging that helped them during the first Trump administration. “There’s a lot of dissatisfaction across the country,” Luria said in an interview. “This administration, these current incumbent members of Congress made lots of promises to the country, to their constituents, and they’ve gone to Washington and done none of it.” In many ways, the stakes of the 2026 midterms mimic those of 2018, when Democrats flipped 40 US House seats during President Donald Trump’s first term with candidates who...",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/news/articles/democrats-helped-flip-house-trump-180059904.html,23/11/2025
US denies pushing Russian 'wish list' as Ukraine plan - Yahoo News Singapore,"Washington insisted Saturday that its Ukraine proposal is indeed official US policy, denying claims by a group of senators that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them the document under discussion is just a Russian ""wish list."" The dispute over the 28-point plan -- which cedes Ukrainian territory long sought by Moscow -- threw an extraordinary element of confusion into efforts to negotiate an end to the war. US President Donald Trump has pushed the plan, pressuring the Ukrainians to accept it within days. Negotiators will meet in Switzerland on Sunday. However, after a storm of criticism that the proposal is almost entirely favorable to Moscow, several US senators spoke out, holding a press conference at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada on Saturday.

Australian mining giant BHP drops Anglo American takeover bid - Yahoo News Singapore,"Australian resources giant BHP said Monday it had dropped a bid to take over British rival Anglo American that would have created the world's largest miner of copper.

But Anglo knocked back the offer.

US President Donald Trump had given Ukraine until November 27 to approve his controversial plan to end the nearly four-year conflict that erupted after Russia launched its full-scale invasion.

50 children in Nigeria escape after kidnapping as 38 worshippers rescued - Yahoo News Singapore,"At least 50 of the more than 300 children snatched by gunmen from a Catholic school in Nigeria have escaped their captors, a Christian group said on Sunday, as the president announced the rescue of 38 worshippers seized in a separate attack last week. Gunmen on Friday raided St Mary's co-education school in Niger state, taking 303 children and 12 teachers in one of the largest mass kidnappings in Nigeria. The abduction came days after gunmen stormed a secondary school in neighbouring Kebbi state, taking 25 girls on Monday. On Tuesday, gunmen raided a church in Kwara state in an attack that was recorded and broadcast online, showing the service being interrupted by gunfire, worshippers fleeing and screaming being heard outside.

Andre Correa do Lago, the dapper Brazilian diplomat who presided over the two-week affair in Belem, opened the final plenary on Saturday afternoon, nearly a full day behind schedule, after nations worked through the night to find a text they could all live with. Bleary-eyed delegates took their seats, eager to see the marathon talks finally come to an end.

Marjorie Taylor Greene says she doesn’t want to run for president in 2028 - Yahoo News Singapore,"Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene denied a report that her decision to resign from Congress in January is driven by a desire to enter the 2028 presidential race. “I’m not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,” she wrote in a lengthy X post on Sunday. The Georgia Republican announced on Friday that she won’t seek reelection and will leave her seat in January, amid a public falling out with her longtime ally President Donald Trump. She had said for weeks Trump is too focused on foreign policy and not doing enough with his domestic agenda. Greene also became among the most vocal critics of the president’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.

Bolsonaro says ankle monitor tampering driven by 'paranoia' - Yahoo News Singapore,"Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro, detained after allegedly using a soldering iron on his court-ordered ankle monitor, argued Sunday that a state of ""paranoia"" had led him to tamper with the device.

Trump’s signals to Zelensky and Europe: Accept this plan or you’re on your own - Yahoo News Singapore,"The 28-point plan hammered out by US and Russian envoys and put to Ukraine this week came with a deadline and an implicit threat: Sign up or face the risk of being abandoned. US President Donald Trump said Friday that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky would “have to like” the US plan, suggesting he is in no mood to negotiate. Since then, Trump has sent mixed messages, saying the plan was not his final offer but adding that if Zelensky did not accept it he could “continue to fight his little heart out.” Zelensky recognized the stark choice in a somber speech to the nation on Friday, casting the plan as a choice between losing the United States as an ally and giving in to Russian demands, which many of the 28 points cater to. If Kyiv were to lose US support, the consequences would be grave for its weapons supplies and access to intelligence, compounding existing crises: a lack of soldiers, a financial crunch and a deepening lack of confidence among Ukrainians in a presidency tainted...",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-signals-zelensky-europe-accept-050159986.html,23/11/2025

And though she saw many of the same faces every day, Kenley said eventually one commuter began to stand out. He wasn’t a Capitol Hill politician or a high-powered lobbyist – he was a fifth grader, named Sam Mencimer. And a very curious one, at that. “I started standing at the front of the bus,” Mencimer recalled to CNN, “and asking lots of questions.” Kenley agreed – Sam asked a lot of questions.

US senators say Rubio told them Trump’s Ukraine peace plan is Russia’s ‘wish list’ - Yahoo News Singapore,"Lawmakers critical of President Donald Trump’s approach to ending the Russia-Ukraine war said Saturday they spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio who told them that the peace plan Trump is pushing Kyiv to accept is a “wish list” of the Russians and not the actual proposal offering Washington’s positions. A State Department spokesperson denied their account, calling it “blatantly false.” Rubio himself then took the extraordinary step of suggesting online that the senators were mistaken, even though they said he was their source for the information. The secretary of state doubled down on the assertion that Washington was responsible for a proposal that had surprised many from the beginning for being so favorable to Moscow. It all added up to a confusing — and potentially embarrassing — turn of events for a Trump administration-blessed peace plan that already faced a potentially rocky future.

Sprawling fraud factories have mushroomed in war-torn Myanmar's border regions, housing scammers who target internet users with romance and business cons worth tens of billions of dollars annually. Myanmar's junta has long been accused of looking the other way as the illicit industry grows, but has trumpeted a crackdown since February after being lobbied by key military backer China, experts say. Additional raids beginning last month were part of a smokescreen, according to some monitors, choreographed to vent pressure from Beijing without too badly denting profits that enrich the junta's militia allies.

Conservationists unite to save London’s rare 'German' hairy snail,"Conservationists and citizen scientists have joined forces for a project to save London's ""charming little"" ice-age hairy snail. Named the German hairy snail because of tiny hairs that cover its shell and because it is believed to originally come from the continent, the rare species is one of the UK's most endangered molluscs. The finger-sized animal (Pseudotrichia rubiginosa) can be found only in small, fragmented patches of its historic damp riverside habitat along the River Thames. The team, led by Citizen Zoo and Zoological Society of London (ZSL), has started a series of surveys to better understand the species' distribution across the capital and inform conservation action. Taking place over the last couple of months, the team has been searching and identifying species at both known and potential river sites in boroughs such as Newham, Richmond upon Thames and Barnet. The team hopes to then build a stronger picture of the snail's current UK range, and identify how habitat...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze8g4g79wgo,24/11/2025

Gyngell rose to fame in the UK after her cafe at Petersham Nurseries in south-west London was awarded a coveted Michelin star, one of the highest culinary honours. She went on to helm Spring restaurant at Somerset House and Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire. Gyngell's family said she died on Saturday in London, describing her as a ""culinary visionary who influenced generations of chefs and growers globally to think about food and its connection to the land"". Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver paid tribute to Gyngell - who was diagnosed with skin cancer last year - and thanked her for ""all you did to inspire young cooks"". During the 1980s, Gyngell pioneered the ""slow food movement"" before becoming a private chef for clients including Nigella Lawson, Madonna and Guy Ritchie.

Faye Moffat, from Prestonpans in East Lothian, accompanied her dad Craig on the arduous ascent of Ben Nevis at the weekend. She pushed through a blizzard to reach the summit and camped overnight on the mountain, so far raising more than £1,000 for the Glasgow Children's Hospital Charity (GCHC). Craig said: ""She faced snow, ice, a blizzard at the summit and a long descent in the dark - but she never once gave up."" He added: ""I'm so proud of Faye for wanting to support such a great charity and also she now has an understanding of the difference we can all make.""

A star since the 1960s, he helped to bring the sound of Jamaica to a global audience through hits such as Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want. His lead role as a gun-toting rebel in the 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come is a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema, and was attributed as the movie that brought reggae to America.

Two peers face suspension from House of Lords,"Two peers are set to be suspended from the House of Lords for breaching rules on providing parliamentary services in return for ""payment or reward"". Former Army chief Lord Richard Dannatt and businessman Lord Evans of Watford face suspensions of four and five months respectively. The House of Lords' standards watchdog launched separate investigations into the two men following an undercover operation by the Guardian newspaper. Neither peer appealed the standard commissioner's findings or the sanctions, which will come into force once approved by the House of Lords. In the course of his investigation, the standards commissioner found that crossbench peer Lord Dannatt had breached the code of conduct by corresponding with ministers and government officials about three companies - UK Nitrogen, Teledyne UK and Blue International Holdings - in which he had a financial interest.

Has anyone seen Cole? A family's search for missing teenager,"When 19-year-old Cole Cooper walked out into a cool May night earlier this year, no-one would have imagined he was in the final hours of his life. He had been out with friends at a pub near his home in central Scotland. But hours later his phone was off - no texts, no social media posts. When there was still no trace of him five days later, his family called police. ""I was told that he's just a missing young boy, who's possibly out and drunk,"" said Cole's mum, Wendy Stewart. She said she was told Cole was not high risk. The police risk assessment is a critical part of a missing person inquiry. It's a set of questions establishing the likelihood someone may have come to harm. Questions include any known risk of suicide, and whether it's out of character for the person to have gone missing. The risk rating given by police determines the level of resourcing for the case. Police Scotland says the decision to issue a public appeal is based on the circumstances and that a person's age, sex...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y98dx72j5o,24/11/2025
Hunter syndrome: Boy with rare condition amazes doctors after world-first gene therapy,"A three-year-old boy has astounded doctors with his progress after becoming the first person in the world with his devastating disease to receive a ground-breaking gene therapy. Oliver Chu has a rare, inherited condition called Hunter syndrome - or MPSII - which causes progressive damage to the body and brain. In the most severe cases, patients with the disease usually die before the age of 20. The effects are sometimes described as a type of childhood dementia. Due to a faulty gene, before the treatment Oliver was unable to produce an enzyme crucial for keeping cells healthy. In a world first, medical staff in Manchester have tried to halt the disease by altering Oliver's cells using gene therapy. Prof Simon Jones, who is co-leading the trial tells the BBC: ""I've been waiting 20 years to see a boy like Ollie doing as well as he is, and it's just so exciting.""

'No one will support it': Ukraine's soldiers react to US peace plan,"Ukraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation. The BBC spoke to half a dozen who sent us their views via social media and email in response to the original US plan – details of which were leaked last week. Since then, American and Ukrainian negotiators have been working on changes to the proposals – and are set to continue talks about the ""peace framework"". Of the original US plan, Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it ""sucks… no one will support it"" while an army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an ""absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention"".

When is the Budget and what could Rachel Reeves announce?,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to increase taxes in the Budget on 26 November. She has said she will make the ""necessary choices"" for the economy, to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living. The statement will be made in the House of Commons at about 12:30 GMT. The Leader of the Opposition, Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, will give an immediate response. The government is looking at a range of options to help it raise more money. Reeves has confirmed that both tax rises and spending cuts are on the table. According to government sources, Reeves has decided not to raise income tax rates, a move that had been widely expected. However, speculation remains that the chancellor could extend a freeze on income tax and NI thresholds beyond the planned 2028-29 deadline. Freezing thresholds means that, as salaries rise over time, more people reach an income level at which they start paying tax and NI. Some people have to start paying higher tax rates.

The Ashes 2025-26: Jonathan Agnew on England's preparation before second Test - BBC Sport,"England's two innings in the first Test lasted fewer than 70 overs combined When we heard England were considering sending some players to Canberra for the Lions game, we assumed it would be those in need of practice. The three they are sending - Jacob Bethell, Josh Tongue and Matthew Potts - did not feature in the first Test in Perth and seem highly unlikely to play in the second in Brisbane. It is a bizarre situation. England's original plan was not to send anyone for the game against the Prime Minister's XI, so little has changed. The likes of Zak Crawley, Joe Root and Harry Brook, who appear to need some time at the crease, will be off to Brisbane to bat in the nets. England are responsible for their preparation and their performances on the field. They are responsible for giving it their best shot of winning the Ashes. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. Australia are a superb team in day-night Tests - they have won 13 of their 14 pink-ball matches.

Pep Guardiola: Manchester City boss 'embarrassed and ashamed' of behaviour at Newcastle - BBC Sport,"Pep Guardiola confronted a cameraman at St James' Park on Saturday Pep Guardiola says he is sorry for his confrontation with a cameraman following Manchester City's Premier League defeat at Newcastle on Saturday. City felt they were on the wrong end of a penalty call, a handball shout and a tight offside decision in the 2-1 loss at St James' Park, which left Guardiola furious at full-time. The Spaniard marched onto the pitch at the end, speaking with referee Sam Barrott, while he also pulled the headphones off of a cameraman to say something into his ear. ""I apologised,"" Guardiola said of the incident but did not reveal what was said. ""I feel embarrassed, ashamed when I see it. I don't like it. I apologised after one second to the cameraman. I am who I am. ""After 1,000 games I'm not a perfect person, I make huge mistakes. The reason why is I want to defend my team and my club.""

Both had been criticised by supporters following a poor start to the season that led to Russell Martin's dismissal in October after just 17 games as head coach. Former Manchester United chief executive Stewart only arrived at Ibrox in December, while Thelwell's appointment was announced in April, although he did not take up post until leaving Everton at the end of last season.

Scammers target 12 homes on same Warrington street,"When letters and bank cards mysteriously started popping through his letter box, Paul Harrison grew increasingly worried somebody was trying to steal his identity. And when he discovered neighbours on his Cheshire street had also been receiving suspicious mail they soon found out they were likely being targeted as part of a wider, sophisticated money laundering scam. Mr Harrison, who has lived at his home in Warrington for 22 years, said strange items of post began to arrive in January, addressed to somebody completely unknown to either him or his wife. ""When the first letter arrived from HSBC [it] clearly had a bank card in it,"" he told BBC One's Rip Off Britain programme. After taking the letter to his nearest HSBC branch, Mr Harrison said he was told to return it to the sender, which he did. A few days later, though, a similar letter arrived.

"Offside rule: What is going on with offside, and can it be fixed? - BBC Sport","This video can not be played Forest put on a brilliant display to beat a deflated Liverpool side Maybe it was all very predictable. After being enraged by their disallowed goal at Manchester City before the international break, Liverpool got stung again by the confusing subjective offside law. Was Dan Ndoye impacting Alisson when Murillo gave Nottingham Forest the lead at Anfield? You can make an argument for it, after all he was stood in front of the goalkeeper and the ball went past him. But, like at Manchester City two weeks ago, the video assistant referee (VAR) let the on-field decision stand. In one game, Liverpool have a goal disallowed. In the other, Liverpool concede a goal. It has got to sting. We've been here before, and we'll be here again. And while it might not seem like it right now, discussions about subjective offside decisions are not a new thing.

"UK most expensive place to develop nuclear power, report says","The UK has become the ""most expensive place in the world"" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review which criticises ""overly complex"" bureaucracy around the sector. The report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calls for a ""one-stop shop"" for nuclear decisions. A ""radical reset"" of the rules around nuclear power could save Britain ""tens of billions"" in costs and reverse the industry's ""decline"" in recent years, the Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce said. It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plants to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets. Hinkley Point C in Somerset is expected to start operating in the early 2030s, while Sizewell C - which the government says will be capable of powering six million homes - will follow later that decade.

Budget 2025: What can nervous businesses expect from the Budget?,"Business leaders face a nervous final few days before the chancellor's second Budget, having borne the brunt of a brutal set of tax hikes this time last year. Firms are still reeling from those: the £25bn National Insurance increase and an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage. Confidence in boardrooms has grown increasingly fragile as the Budget nears. Almost all measures of sentiment among chief executives and finance bosses in the last six months have shown alarm bells ringing. So what can nervous business owners and leaders expect from Rachel Reeves? We are certain taxes will rise, and that takes money out of the economy. Research firm Capital Economics estimates the Budget will knock 0.2% off GDP in 2026 – a meaningful hit to an economy that only grew 0.1% in the third quarter of this year. However, as the chancellor pulls money out of the economy, the Bank of England is likely to push money back in by lowering interest rates, encouraging people and businesses to borrow and...",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dz7gr042no,24/11/2025
Australia senator condemned for burka stunt in parliament,"An Australian senator has provoked anger for wearing a burka in parliament, after pushing for a ban on the Muslim garment. Pauline Hanson was condemned by fellow senators, with one accusing her of ""blatant racism"". Proceedings in the senate were halted as she refused to remove the item. The Queensland senator, of the anti-immigration One Nation party, was seeking to introduce a bill that would ban full face coverings in public – a policy she has long campaigned for. It is the second time she has worn the garment – which covers the face and body – in parliament, and said her actions were in protest at the senate rejecting her bill. Shortly after other lawmakers blocked her from introducing the bill on Monday, she returned wearing a black burka.

Does JD Vance have a Palantir problem? | CNN Politics,"In a recent conversation, Vice President JD Vance asked Roger Stone, President Donald Trump‚Äôs longtime confidant, for his biggest concern facing the country.

For years, Democrats have zeroed in on Vance‚Äôs relationship with Palantir‚Äôs co-founder Peter Thiel, the iconoclastic tech titan who gave Vance one of his first jobs and later put $15 million behind his successful 2022 Ohio Senate bid. But the pressure on Vance is now coming from inside Trump‚Äôs coalition.

Senate Republicans agreed to hold a mid-December vote on extending the enhanced subsidies, which are set to lapse at year‚Äôs end, in exchange for extending government funding through January, spurring the effort by Trump and his aides to develop their own competing proposal.

New clues hint at early signs of domestication in raccoons that feast on urban trash | CNN,"The clever, adaptable urban raccoon may be evolving a shorter snout ‚Äî a key physical trait of pets and other domesticated animals. The new finding describes what a biologist says could be the first account of domestication in its earliest stages. For Raffaela Lesch, an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, inspiration struck while she was walking around the campus. She had tossed a can into a waste bin, and it landed with a thud instead of a clang. Soon, Lesch realized why, as a raccoon ‚Äî aka a ‚Äútrash panda‚Äù ‚Äî popped its head out of the garbage. Lesch reflected on how prevalent and comfortable raccoons can be in urban environments ‚Äî even in the middle of the day ‚Äî and it sparked her curiosity: Could she be witnessing the early stages of the same process that led to the domestication of dogs thousands of years ago? ‚ÄúThat was the first moment where I started to wonder if we might have a difference in rural and urban populations, where urban...",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/24/science/raccoons-urban-trash-domestication-shorter-snouts,24/11/2025
More Americans are taking out riskier adjustable-rate home loans | CNN Business,"Nakul Mishra is already thinking about refinancing ‚Äì even before he closes on his first home. The 34-year-old had spent two years searching for the right home in Sacramento to settle into with his family. He finally found one he could afford, but not without some risk. This month, Mishra opted to take out a seven-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), betting he‚Äôll score a lower rate before the fixed period expires. It‚Äôs a calculation more buyers are making lately as ARMs ‚Äì the mortgage products that helped fuel housing market risk in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis ‚Äì regain popularity. An ARM loan offers Mishra something fixed-rate mortgages can‚Äôt: short-term breathing room from high borrowing costs. But they come with a risk. After a fixed introductory period, usually five, seven or 10 years, an ARM‚Äôs rate resets with the market. If rates rise, monthly payments can surge. Still, the number of Americans turning to these riskier loans has climbed sharply. The...",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/24/economy/adjustable-rate-mortgages-risks,24/11/2025
HMS Severn: British navy intercepts Russian corvette and tanker as Moscow steps up naval activity | CNN,"A UK patrol ship has intercepted a Russian corvette and a tanker after shadowing them through the English Channel, the Defense Ministry said Sunday, adding that Russian naval activity around UK waters had increased by 30% over the past two years.

"Semaglutide fails to slow progression of Alzheimer‚Äôs in highly anticipated trials, Novo Nordisk says | CNN","An oral version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, failed to slow the progression of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease in closely watched trials, Novo Nordisk said Monday. In two Phase 3 trials of more than 3,800 adults receiving standard care for Alzheimer‚Äôs, the company evaluated whether an older pill form of semaglutide worked better than a placebo. The drug was shown to be safe and led to improvements in Alzheimer‚Äôs-related biomarkers, the company said, but the treatment did not delay disease progression. Novo had long treated Alzheimer‚Äôs as a long-shot bet for the popular GLP-1 drugs. Use of these drugs for diabetes and weight loss has exploded in recent years, and they have shown benefits for a wide range of additional health conditions, such as protecting the heart and kidneys, reducing sleep apnea and potentially helping with addiction.

(ISIL didn’t even exist at the time of the uprising.) The Boy Who Started the Syrian War would change the narrative. Now, with the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime along with its army and militia, the Shabiha, it’s time to meet once again with the surviving characters from the original film.

Fire alert: the fake ‘Amazon TV stick’ that opens the door to fraudsters | Scams | The Guardian,"Two out of five illegal streamers have fallen prey to fraud, likely via a ‘modded’ USB stick that exposes users to data theft and cybercrime The big fight is on TV on Saturday night but you really don’t want to shell out to watch it on pay-per-view.

Why did young men move left in this month’s US elections? | Cory Alpert | The Guardian,"Democrats’ relentless focus on affordability welcomed in a group that had been seduced by an ecosystem of hucksters Just a few months ago, it seemed that the political landscape was changing permanently, with young people shifting right – especially young men. Democrats spun up a vortex of efforts to win them back, but they often appeared to be flailing. This month’s elections, however, told a different story. Young men in the US face a political identity crisis. It should not be controversial to say that the world that many were promised as children has not come to fruition. Two decades of war and a turbulent economy have combined with a massively changing workforce. Young men’s disaffection should come as no real surprise. An entire ecosystem of hucksters has emerged to take advantage of these young people, peddling a dark vision that offers violence and control as a response to a changing world.

Guitar Hero at 20 – how a plastic axe bridged the gap between rock generations | Games | The Guardian,"Guitar Hero’s controllers let anyone become a star in their own living room – and made the bands featured in the game household names again It is 20 years since Guitar Hero was launched in North America, and with it, the tools for the everyday gamer to become a rock star. Not literally of course, but try telling that to someone who has nailed Free Bird’s four-minute guitar solo in front of a packed living-room audience. Developed by Harmonix, published by RedOctane and inspired by Konami’s GuitarFreaks, Guitar Hero gave players a guitar-shaped controller with which to match coloured notes scrolling down the screen in time with a song. Each riff or sequence corresponded to specific notes, creating the feel of a genuine performance.

It feels like it should be cleaned up, but it won’t be. The rind is not rubbish discarded by a careless visitor: it’s a perfect resin cast made by Armanious. Placed carefully around the gallery are resin recreations of other items more commonly seen in bins: a group of melted candles, blobs of Blu-Tack, crumbly chunks of polystyrene.

The 37-year-old Swede, who appeared poised to take charge at Swansea until Boro’s hijacking of that mooted deal, will aim to reinforce a reputation as one of Europe’s brightest emerging coaches. After securing two consecutive second-place finishes in Sweden’s top tier at Hammarby, Hellberg has become something of a hot property and is tasked with leading second-placed Boro back into the Premier League. They have paid about £250,000 to extract Hellberg from his contract and hope he can continue the job started by Rob Edwards.

Monkey soulmates and extraordinary talent: the man Charlie Chaplin called ‘the greatest actor in the world’ | Film | The Guardian,"Michel Simon, who steals the show in Jean Vigo’s 1934 masterpiece L’Atalante, was a soft-faced, gravelly voiced clown capable of tremendous pathos – and total chaos Jean Vigo’s L’Atalante, his poetic and surreal 1934 romance about a young couple living on a canal barge, is one of the most beautiful, sensual films of all time. Dita Parlo and Jean Dasté play the newlyweds getting awkwardly accustomed to married life in close quarters, and their love story shapes the film. But it’s their bargemate, the uncouth Père Jules, played by Michel Simon, who steals the show: a well-travelled sailor speckled with tattoos, standing guard over a cabinet of risque and macabre curiosities, whose cabin teems with cats every bit as unruly as he is.

Donald Trump’s administration has steadily increased pressure on Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of running the “Cartel of the Suns” drug-trafficking organization, and placing a $50m bounty on his head. The US leader has been opaque about his intentions and Trump says he is keeping all options on the table – from a military intervention to a negotiated exit for Maduro.

Tell us: have you visited or worked at a UK ‘warm bank’? | Energy bills | The Guardian,"We want to hear people’s experiences with the rise of ‘warm spaces’ in the UK Bitter Arctic air has swept across the UK this month, causing winter to arrive early for millions of people, with temperatures in some places plunging below zero. On 1 October the energy price cap rose 2% to £1,755 for a typical annual dual-fuel bill in Great Britain. That was on top of existing debt to energy suppliers of £4.4bn in June, according to Ofgem – which should “ring alarm bells” for lawmakers, said a coordinator at the End Fuel Poverty Coalition. Since the cost of living crisis began in 2022, the UK has seen the rise in warm banks as spaces where people could escape freezing homes.

I endured an English public school. But that’s not the only reason I’m unsurprised about the Farage allegations | Musa Okwonga | The Guardian,"Let’s put aside the schooldays accusations and look, instead, at the Reform leader’s path since then. I think a pretty clear picture of the man emerges When I see the allegations of racism against Nigel Farage from his schooldays, I can’t say I am greatly surprised. There are those who believe that the Reform UK leader’s persona must have been developed to win over working-class voters, or the “red wall”. I know that it is quite in keeping with the sentiments expressed by plenty of young men in elite institutions like English public schools – the kind of men who run the world. Farage was educated at Dulwich college from 1975 to 1982; there, fellow students have told the Guardian, he allegedly used racist insults about fellow pupils and sang a song with the lyrics “Gas ’em all”. I attended Eton a couple of decades later, but the attitudes of some of the people I encountered there were not very different.

Bad Omens review – anthemic songs and pillars of fire dampened by arena nerves | Metal | The Guardian,"OVO Hydro, GlasgowNoah Sebastian’s vocals switch deftly from croon to scream to whisper, but the genre-hopping US metalcore band lack chemistry on the big stage Melodic metalcore band Bad Omens are pulling out all the stops for their first UK arena headline tour. In the first five minutes, we’ve experienced huge riffs, pillars of fire and supernatural horror-inspired visuals. Formed in 2015, the US band found mainstream success in 2022 with their third album The Death of Peace of Mind, which embraced the kind of hooky pop songwriting and complex storytelling that made the band irresistible on TikTok. Although their fourth studio album is yet to be released, this tour represents their graduation to the same league as genre titans Bring Me the Horizon, who they supported last year.

How did McLaren get it so wrong with their cars in Las Vegas? | McLaren | The Guardian,"Disqualifications of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri bring unnecessary stress for McLaren in the final two F1 races of the season As misjudgments go, McLaren’s error in calculations that led to the disqualification of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri from the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Sunday could barely have been more cataclysmic nor more poorly timed. Quite how they got it wrong just when they wanted to close out the drivers’ championship with as little fuss as possible will take no little explanation. Norris and Piastri, second and fourth respectively to Max Verstappen’s win in Nevada, had been solid enough results until the FIA discovered the skid blocks on their cars had been worn beyond the 9mm limit. In one fell swoop, Verstappen was right back in the fight, alongside Piastri, 24 points back from Norris.

Old boozers are reclaimed, reloved and restored, and the great tradition of going down the pub is celebrated. The Devonshire in nearby Piccadilly is, of course, the daddy, the Darth Vader of this trend, winning plaudits, TikTok adoration and celebrity fans aplenty.

Arsenal’s Premier League dominance is not under threat. At least not yet | Premier League | The Guardian,"Eberechi Eze’s hat-trick and Manchester City’s loss to Newcastle means Arsenal are in control of their own destiny Sign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson here So it turns out those who had already handed the title to Arsenal were right after all. It’s absurd, of course, to start handing out the title in November but a feature of modern football is how obsessed it becomes so early with title races. It’s perhaps a legacy of the Pep Guardiola-Jürgen Klopp rivalry’s peak, when being champion meant amassing more than 95 points. It made sense then to scan the track far ahead for any potential hurdles because there were so few. But less than a third of the way through this season, Manchester City, who remain probably the biggest danger to Arsenal, have already dropped as many points as they did in the entirety of 2017-18, their 100-point campaign.

Could you do better than Reeves as chancellor?

On 26 November, Rachel Reeves will deliver this year’s budget to parliament.

The Guardian view on the young person’s benefit trap: Rachel Reeves must fix this flaw in the budget | Editorial | The Guardian,"The system discourages young homeless people from earning more – that’s the very opposite of Labour’s aim to make work pay Consider being a young homeless person on benefits today. Those aged 16-24 who can’t live at home often end up in supported housing. This could be a shared flat or a hostel, where specialist staff are on hand to help. But such young people frequently have to cover service charges and bills – at an age when they should be building a future, not worrying about basic costs. It’s good that the state steps in to support vulnerable young people. But wrong that it can undermine that help in practice. For the last eight years, campaigners have warned that young people in supported housing are penalised more harshly for earning than their non-homeless counterparts – and it’s a UK-wide problem. For every £1 these youngsters earn over their small earnings allowance, their housing benefit is reduced by 65p, compared with 55p for those in the private rental sector.

But they might well be bemused that the ordinary garments they cut generously, to allow movement while operating a machine or driving a train, are now highly collectible and sought after – worn by men who do little more than swivel on an office chair. If you’ve not noticed the prevalence of the dull tan of the Carhartt barn jacket or the triple-patch pocket of the chore coat, then perhaps you’ve been living in a cave with no signal to receive Instagram ads. Marks & Spencer is abundant with chore jackets and, in this year’s John Lewis Christmas advert, the dad has his suitably saccharine emotional moment wearing one, too.

"The one change that worked: I was trembling with anxiety when I found a fun, free way to get calm | Health & wellbeing | The Guardian","I can’t dance. Not even a little bit. But the terrible moves my friends mock are an antidote to the racing heart and quivering breath that arrive in my more anxious moments The first time I started dancing at home was a happy accident. I’d just had a terse conversation with an ex, and my body was reacting in its usual way: racing heart, quivering breath and trembling fingers. I needed to calm down. Looking around for quick fixes in my flat – my bed, some stale chocolate digestives and a packet of cigarettes – I settled on the kitchen radio, which had been humming faintly in the background all morning. Tuned to BBC Radio 6 Music, it was playing a disco track I didn’t recognise. But the beat was steady and intermingled with the sounds of tambourines, synths and drums. I turned up the volume, and then my body was moving: limbs swinging, feet tapping, hips wiggling. I continued into the next song, leaning into the feeling and becoming more animated to the sounds of another upbeat 70s...",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/24/the-one-change-that-worked-i-was-trembling-with-anxiety-when-i-found-a-fun-free-way-to-get-calm,24/11/2025
Politicians urge Labour to restore Electoral Commission independence | Electoral Commission | The Guardian,"All-party group say move is needed to stop UK lagging behind global standards on election integrity Keir Starmer is being urged to restore independence to the Electoral Commission, with MPs and peers likely to launch a battle to amend the elections bill in the new year. In a letter to the prime minister, MPs and peers will warn the elections watchdog should not be overseen by the political parties in charge of holding to account. The government is to publish an elections bill early next year, bringing in votes for 16-year-olds and cracking down on loopholes in how political donations are made. However, it is resisting returning independence to the Electoral Commission after Boris Johnson put it under the control of ministers, who can now annually set its priorities and direction. When the Conservatives introduced the new power, the House of Lords passed a cross-party amendment led by the cross-bench peer Lord Judge and co-sponsored by the former Labour home secretary David Blunkett to...",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/24/politicians-urge-labour-to-restore-electoral-commission-independence,24/11/2025
"Risk of Maccabi Tel Aviv facing antisemitic attacks not ‘predominant’ reason for match ban, police tell MPs – UK politics live | Politics | The Guardian","MPs have been told that the risk of antisemitic hate crime was not the “predominant” reason why West Midlands police wanted to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending the Europa League match at Aston Villa. Mike O’Hara, WMP’s assistant chief constable, said in a letter to the Commons home affairs committee that the threat of violence by Maccabi fans was a more important consideration. The letter, which has been published this afternoon by the committee, confirms reporting by the Guardian last month which said that the fans were banned “after police intelligence concluded the biggest risk of violence came from extremist fans of the Israeli club”. Keir Starmer and other political leaders reacted with outrage after the ban was first announced in October. Starmer suggested the police were accepting they would not be able to protect the Maccabi supporters from antisemitic violence, and he said: “The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of...",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/24/budget-labour-rachel-reeves-criticism-conservatives-nigel-farage-latest-news-updates,24/11/2025
Readers reply: Do good fences really make good neighbours? | Life and style | The Guardian,"The long-running series in which readers answer other readers’ questions. This week, the knotty issue of home boundaries, and what the saying was intended to mean They say “good fences make good neighbours”, presumably meaning that the stronger the boundary between you and people you need to deal with, the more robust the relationship. Is this really true? Jamila, via email Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. The original quote is from the Robert Frost poem Mending Wall and profoundly misunderstood. Instead of an argument for strong barriers and isolation from those nearby, it describes the bonds that neighbours forge and strengthen while working in tandem to repair a stone fence in the woods.

Thomas Frank desperately needs a performance from his stalled Spurs team | Tottenham Hotspur | The Guardian,"Tottenham manager can afford a midweek defeat in Paris, but the same does not apply to Fulham’s visit on Saturday Welcome, then, to another of those Spurs weeks, where the executives are deeply concerned and it is impossible to ignore the sense of foreboding. The 4-1 derby humiliation at Arsenal on Sunday ensured the club are playing a game of crisis-baton hot potato with Liverpool and surely the last thing that the manager, Thomas Frank, needs is a Champions League trip to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night. This is not the real fear because it is just about possible to paint the game against the European champions as a free hit. Even in the best of times, nobody would have expected much from Tottenham there and, with two wins and two draws from four matches in the competition, they can afford to lose this one.

WSL concerned by Sky broadcast slots after low TV audience figures for derby | Women's Super League | The Guardian,"Arsenal v Chelsea was watched by only 71,000 viewers Saturday noon kick-off believed to be a factor in drop-off The Women’s Super League is concerned about its broadcast slots this season after only 71,000 people watched televised coverage of the flagship fixture between Arsenal and Chelsea this month. The average audience on Sky Sports Main Event was 55,900 – lower than the 57,000 attendance at the Emirates Stadium – with a further 15,100 viewers tuning in on Sky Sports Premier League. The corresponding fixture last season attracted an audience of 732,000 because it was free-to-air on the BBC and took place during the men’s international break. Multiple sources within the sport have said the noon Saturday kick-off time was the biggest factor behind the drop-off for that game, which is concerning for the WSL given that most of its TV games will kick off at lunchtime this season.

"Hip-hop godfathers the Last Poets: ‘In times of great chaos, there’s opportunity’ | Hip-hop | The Guardian","The two remaining members of the groundbreaking, politically revolutionary group talk about the state of hip-hop and the US government’s attacks on people of color For the first time in 35 years, Billboard’s Hot 100 chart does not include a rap song among its top 40 hit records. Anyone who’s been listening to the music for at least that long can list myriad reasons why that’s now the case: all the beats sound the same, all the artists are industry plants, all the lyrics are barely intelligible etc. For hip-hop forefather Abiodun Oyewole, though, it boils down to this: “We embraced ‘party and bullshit’, my brother.” Fifty-seven years ago, on what would have been Malcolm X’s 43rd birthday, Oyewole cliqued up with two young poets at a writers’ workshop in East Harlem’s Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park) to form what would become the Last Poets, a collective of bard revolutionaries.

Zombie fires: how Arctic wildfires that come back to life are ravaging forests | Wildfires | The Guardian,"Blazes that smoulder in the permafrost, only to reignite, are extending fire season though winter, leaving vegetation struggling to recover In May 2023, a lightning strike hit the forest in Donnie Creek, British Columbia, and the trees started to burn. It was early in the year for a wildfire, but a dry autumn and warm spring had turned the forest into a tinderbox, and the flames spread rapidly. By mid-June, the fire had become one of largest in the province’s history, burning through an area of boreal forest nearly twice the size of central London. That year, more of Canada burned than ever before. The return of cold and snow at the close of the year typically signal the end of the wildfire season. But this time, the fire did not stop. Instead, it smouldered in the soil underground, insulated from the freezing conditions by the snowpack. The next spring, it reemerged as a “zombie fire” that continued to burn until August 2024. By then, more than 600,000 hectares (1.5m acres) had been...",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/24/zombie-fires-arctic-wildfires-reignite-ravaging-forests-aoe,24/11/2025
Reform UK claim to have saved £331m at English councils – but do the numbers stack up? | Reform UK | The Guardian,"Experts say councils face limits on cuts as Reform’s savings on IT deals, office moves and EV projects are disputed Reform UK has ignored requests to share the evidence for its claim to have saved £331m since it took charge of 10 English councils in May, prompting questions over whether the figure is true. The party has boasted that it had achieved £331m worth of savings at English councils it controls. Warning of a “blob” of vested interests devoted to “ripping off” taxpayers, Richard Tice, the new head of the party’s self-styled ‘Doge’ cost-cutting unit, added: “We’re going to war with these people”. Yet on closer analysis, examples of supposed savings at councils ranging from Durham to its “showcase” Kent appear questionable. In some cases, credit is claimed for initiatives already set in train by predecessors. When the supposed savings initiatives described by Reform are totted up, there is still an unexplained shortfall of £260m.

‘An inner duty’: the 35-year quest to bring Bach’s lost organ works to light | JS Bach | The Guardian,"Musicologist Peter Wollny chanced upon the manuscripts in 1992 and authenticating them took half of his lifetime The best fictional detectives are famed for their intuition, an ability to spot some seemingly ineffable discrepancy. Peter Wollny, the musicologist behind last week’s “world sensational” revelation of two previously unknown works by Johann Sebastian Bach, had a funny feeling when he chanced upon two intriguing sheets of music in a dusty library in 1992. His equivalent of the Columbo turn, from mere hunch to unravelling a secret, would take up half his life. Wollny, now 65 and the director of Leipzig’s Bach archive, was a graduate student at Harvard University when his PhD research took him to the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels, where he came across two unattributed scores from the 18th century. “I have to confess that I didn’t even think these were works by Bach at the time,” Wollny said this week, days after the two pieces – Chaconne in D minor BWV 1178 and Chaconne...",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/24/an-inner-duty-the-35-year-quest-to-bring-bachs-lost-organ-works-to-light,24/11/2025
Argentina lodge complaint and urge investigation into Tom Curry over alleged tunnel scuffle | England rugby union team | The Guardian,"Felipe Contepomi called England flanker a ‘bully’ Post-match incident follows anger over Curry tackle Argentina have lodged a complaint and called for an investigation into the alleged tunnel scuffle involving the England flanker Tom Curry and their head coach, Felipe Contepomi, after Sunday’s game at Twickenham. In an extraordinary press conference after England’s 27-23 victory, Contepomi described Curry as a “bully” and accused the flanker of shoving him in the tunnel and telling him to “fuck off”. Contepomi also claimed Curry had “broken” the knee of the Argentina full-back Juan Cruz Mallía with a “reckless” tackle – an incident that seemed to spark the bad blood after the final whistle. Argentina have confirmed that Mallía has a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee after Curry’s tackle. There is a 24-hour citing window for Six Nations Rugby – organiser of the Autumn Nations Series – to bring action against the England back-row for the tackle, while it can also begin...",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/24/argentina-complaint-investigation-tom-curry-tunnel-six-nations-rugby-union,24/11/2025
Trump’s ‘peace plan’ was a pro-Kremlin abomination whose failure is a glimmer of hope for Ukraine | Rajan Menon | The Guardian,"Following criticism, the president accused Ukraine of ingratitude but also added the plan was ‘not my final offer’. Which parts of it will survive? The US president, Donald Trump, has said “something good just may be happening” at the talks in Switzerland intended to end the war in Ukraine. European and Ukrainian negotiators have been attempting to “rework” the 28-point peace plan that the president put forward last week into one more favourable to Ukraine. Trump keeps signalling that he is willing to compromise, but his original plan put Ukraine in a very tough starting position, handing Vladimir Putin concessions that Russia has so far failed to gain on the battlefield. It is true Russia has made recent advances – especially around Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk province, and in parts of Zaporizhzhia. And Ukraine lacks the troops and firepower to retake all the territory lost since 2022, let alone Crimea.

Private finance plans for NHS buildings | NHS | The Guardian,"Johnbosco Nwogbo says adding a new private finance debt burden is a bad idea, while Lord Hutton thinks PFIs have been good for the NHS and patients Labour MPs are absolutely right to reject Wes Streeting’s plan to use private capital to build neighbourhood health centres (Labour MPs urge Reeves to drop private finance plans for NHS buildings, 21 November). Like a family using a payday loan to buy their home, yes, we’d end up with a building, but we’ll have to sacrifice meals to keep up with the payments. Given Rachel Reeves’s lack of fiscal wiggle room, no one believes that the NHS’s budget will increase year-on-year to keep pace with the combined financial impact of inflation, the growing health needs of our ageing population and possible rising drug prices. So adding a new private finance debt burden to this cocktail will only result in trusts skimping on the only one of those things they have control over: patient care.

Shabana Mahmood is an avatar of open Britain – that’s what makes her fable about immigration so seductive | Nesrine Malik | The Guardian,"‘She is the daughter of immigrants,’ supporters of her cruel asylum policies say. ‘How can she be wrong?’ Let me put them straight Over the past couple of weeks, Shabana Mahmood has launched not only her new asylum crackdown policy, but also her “story”. The two are inseparable: her story justifies the crackdown. It moralises the crackdown. And it silences criticism of the crackdown. Sold as an origin story from within an immigrant and racialised experience, the purpose is to imbue her politics with sacred authenticity – the credibility of the first person. It is clever and effective. It is cynical and disgraceful. “I am the child of immigrants” is how Mahmood now starts her fable. Immigrants who came here legally. She goes on to tell us that immigration is tearing this country apart, and proposes policies that mean UK-born children, who have known no life anywhere else, will be deported.

Labour’s immigration policy is not the Britain we want | Immigration and asylum | The Guardian,"Readers respond to the government’s recently announced measures for curbing the number of asylum seekers On 8 July 2013, the newly elected Pope Francis travelled to the island of Lampedusa to speak of the migrants who had died crossing the sea: “These brothers and sisters of ours were trying to escape difficult situations to find some serenity and peace; they were looking for a better place for themselves and their families, but instead they found death.” He went on to say: “Our shared response may be articulated by four verbs: to welcome, to protect, to promote, and to integrate.” Later that same year, a boat carrying over 500 migrants from Eritrea, Somalia and Ghana caught fire and capsized near Lampedusa, killing at least 368 people. Now, we have a proposed system that is, as Stella Creasy describes, “not just performatively cruel, it’s economically misjudged” (ICE-style raids on Britain’s streets: that’s all Labour’s brutal asylum reforms will achieve, 17 November).

Farage urged to explain conspiracy theories linked to antisemitism he voiced in US media | Nigel Farage | The Guardian,"Exclusive: The Reform UK leader discussed far-right talking points in web TV and radio appearances between 2009 and 2018 Nigel Farage is facing calls to explain why he repeatedly aired tropes and conspiracy theories associated with antisemitism during interviews, after claims the Reform UK leader used racist language in his teens. In appearances on US TV shows and podcasts earlier in his political career, Farage discussed supposed plots by bankers to create a global government, citing Goldman Sachs, the Bilderberg group and the financier George Soros as threats to democracy. These included six guest slots on the web TV show of the disgraced far-right US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones was successfully sued by bereaved parents after claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre was faked.

The findings prompted a senior police officer to warn that the use of AI is accelerating an epidemic in violence against women and girls (VAWG), and that technology companies are complicit in this abuse. The survey of 1,700 people commissioned by the office of the police chief scientific adviser found 13% felt there was nothing wrong with creating and sharing sexual or intimate deepfakes – digitally altered content made using AI without consent.

"As Epstein questions linger, Trump falls back into familiar habit: lashing out at female reporters | Donald Trump | The Guardian","He called one a ‘piggy’ after being questioned about the files, and reacted furiously to another during a meeting with the Saudi crown prince Since the early days of his political career, Donald Trump has been critical of the media, but in recent days his hostility has reached a new peak – particularly when it comes to questions about his association with the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Trump invoked the phrase “piggy” – a term he has used before – to describe a female reporter on Friday, and has aggressively responded to at least one other female reporter over the past week, including threatening to revoke ABC’s license. The outbursts come at a tense time for Trump, after the Republican party issued arguably its largest rebuke to the president since he cemented his position as the GOP leader.

Holbein: Renaissance Master by Elizabeth Goldring review – a magnificent portrait of the artist | Books | The Guardian,"The first scholarly biography in more than 100 years of the man who immortalised the Tudor court does not disappoint Much of what we know, or think we know, about the court of Henry VIII comes directly from the paintings of Hans Holbein. There’s the famous portrait of the king himself – puffy, phallic and cruel, looking more like a murderer than a monarch. But there is also ascetic Thomas More, hiding his cruel streak behind fine bones, and sly yet thuggish Thomas Cromwell, with those shifty eyes and the beginnings of a double chin. “Hans the Painter” did the wives too – an appropriately sketchy drawing of Anne Boleyn, a saintly portrait of Jane Seymour who died after giving birth to Henry’s heir, and a pin-up version of Anne of Cleves. It was this last portrait that caused an international incident in 1539 when Holbein was sent by Henry to the Low Countries to check whether Anne was pretty enough to be his next wife.

The idea is that too many women in the workplace, and in positions of power, has led to the dominance of stereotypical feminine values, to the detriment of everyone. Girly things like conflict resolution rather than manly plain speaking, fussy HR departments, or a lack of healthy aggressive competition, have all created an imbalance in the workplace and in the world, suppressing stereotypical masculine values.

India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was among those who paid tribute to Dharmendra after it was announced he had died at home in Mumbai on Monday morning. Modi said that his death marked the end of an era in Indian cinema. “He was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,” Modi said on X. Often called Bollywood’s “He-Man” in reference to his muscular physique, handsome looks and rugged charm, Dharmendra was known for his versatility in roles that spanned...",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/dharmendra-bollywood-he-man-enduring-star-dies,24/11/2025
"‘The world is such a nice thing!’: Matt Maltese, the songwriter for pop’s A-list … and Shakespeare | Music | The Guardian","After getting dropped by a major label, the Leonard Cohen-influenced south Londoner kept going, and has now won fans in Rosalía, Sabrina Carpenter and more. But writing for the Bard is the best of all, he says Three years back, Matt Maltese was in a casual co-writing session with some friends. Out of it came a song called Magnolias, a stripped back piano ballad about imagining his own funeral. “I didn’t think anything of it,” he says. “And then two years later, we heard some quite bizarre whispers that Rosalía had somehow heard it.” It was true: six months ago, Maltese was sent the Spanish pop star’s demo of the song. He tried not to get too excited, even when, a few weeks back, a blurred-out photo of a Rosalía album tracklisting appeared online. “On the WhatsApp group we were like: I think that says Magnolias!” Magnolias ended up as the final track on Rosalía’s new operatic masterpiece, Lux: one of the most talked-about albums of the year, currently sitting in the UK Top 5.

I arrived to find the Pennines under a thick blanket of cloud and the temperature hovering around zero. So it’s just as well that music is a largely indoor pursuit: since 1978, autumn here has meant the annual influx of big names in experimental and avant garde music for the Huddersfield Contemporary Music festival. Once a draw for postwar heavyweights including Karlheinz Stockhausen, Olivier Messiaen and John Cage, the HCMF remains the UK’s largest international festival dedicated to new music, with more than 30 world and UK premieres on this year’s programme.

Still Pushing Pineappples review – Black Lace trouper on sad disco circuit from Blackpool to Benidorm | Film | The Guardian,"Kim Hopkins’ documentary follows Dene Michael, of 1980s novelty pop act Black Lace, as he belts out the band’s hits – though it misses out a key part of his life This sweet, sad documentary – which a bit of Googling, however, reveals to be rather contrived – is a study of Dene Michael, a middle-aged man from Leeds who once upon a time was part of the 1980s novelty band Black Lace, known and feared for their earworm hit single, Agadoo, with its weird lyrics about pushing pineapples and shaking trees. The band’s lineup changed about as often as that of the Fall, and Michael was once one of the guys singing backing vocals while dressed as a pineapple. But when frontman Colin Gibb was forced out after an underage sex scandal, and the other frontman, Alan Barton, left to join the band Smokie, Michael was taken out of the pineapple costume, promoted to singer and effectively left in sole charge of the band. Since the 1980s, he has been endlessly touring the sad disco circuit from Blackpool...",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/24/still-pushing-pineappples-review-documentary-black-lace-agadoo,24/11/2025
UK launches critical minerals strategy to reduce dependency on China | UK news | The Guardian,"Standoff between China and EU over supply of chips for car industry underlines value of sector requiring huge financial investment Keir Starmer has announced a critical minerals and rare earths strategy to build resilience against China, which has a stranglehold on supplies of materials including magnets critical to everything from car doors to fridges. “For too long, Britain has been dependent on a handful of overseas suppliers, leaving our economy and national security exposed to global shocks,” the prime minister said. The critical minerals initiative comes with a £50m fund to boost production at tungsten and lithium mines in Cornwall. Europe’s largest deposits of lithium are in Cornwall, and the EU singled out the county’s tungsten mine for potential financial support this summer. The strategy follows a six-week standoff between China and the EU over the supply of chips used in the car industry, underlining how Beijing is willing to use trade in critical materials for political...",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/23/uk-launches-critical-minerals-strategy-to-reduce-dependency-on-china,23/11/2025
The fascia secret: how does it affect your health – and should you loosen it up with a foam roller? | Life and style | The Guardian,"Our muscles, bones and organs are held together by a network of tissue that influences our every move. Is there a way we can use it to our advantage? Fascia, the connective tissue that holds together the body’s internal structure, really hasn’t spent all that long in the limelight. Anatomists have known about its existence since before the Hippocratic oath was a thing, but until the 1980s it was routinely tossed in the bin during human dissections, regarded as little more than the wrapping that gets in the way of studying everything else. Over the past few decades, though, our understanding of it has evolved and (arguably) overshot – now, there are plenty of personal trainers who will insist that you should be loosening it up with a foam roller, or even harnessing its magical elastic powers to jump higher and do more press-ups. But what’s it really doing – and is there a way you can actually take advantage of it? “The easiest way to describe fascia is to think about the structure of a...",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/24/secrets-of-the-body-what-is-fascia-health-foam-roller,24/11/2025

Sadly, Solomon is used to such turmoil. He discusses hostility, hope and asylum hotels Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, is at his home in London when I meet him. It’s the start of a gruesome week. The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has just announced that refugees could have their status revoked at any time if the country from which they fled is deemed safe; the pathway from being granted asylum to getting citizenship would increase to 20 years; AI would be used to establish a refugee’s age; and – a strikingly nasty idea – the jewellery of those arriving in the UK could be seized.

A wealth tax would be simple and fair – what’s not to like? | Budget 2025 | The Guardian,"Readers respond to an article by Aditya Chakrabortty that said a 1% levy on the super-rich wouldn’t be enough to tackle Britain’s inequality Aditya Chakrabortty claims that wealth tax proposals are a “pantomime of pseudo-radicalism” (What does the left want? A wealth tax. What will that accomplish? Very little, 20 November). He notes that the Wealth Tax Commission in 2020 estimated that an annual wealth tax of 1.12% on assets over £10m could bring in £10bn a year, describing it as “handy, but in Whitehall terms hardly life-changing”. This amount is far from trivial. Earlier this year, our government was trying to push through cuts to disability benefits that would have plunged hundreds of thousands into poverty to save half that. Although a backlash stopped them, Rachel Reeves has said that she can’t “leave welfare untouched” and is still considering how to claw billions from the most vulnerable.

Macron and Merz must look at themselves if they want to stop Europe sliding to the far right | European Union | The Guardian,"Political elites in Europe’s ‘mature’ democracies warn of external threats – but at home they normalise racism and undermine the rule of law Europe’s leaders cannot stop talking about democracy. President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to kickstart a democratic “resurgence”, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, has warned of an “axis” of autocratic states targeting liberal democracy in Europe. Having promised to “fight” for what she calls European “values”, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has just announced a new “democracy shield” and a Centre for Democratic Resilience to prevent foreign interference and deal with external threats. I keep hoping for similar scrutiny of democratic backsliding within the EU – but so far it has not happened.

Gallus in Weegieland review – hilarious show sends Alice down a class rabbit hole | Theatre | The Guardian,"Tron theatre, Glasgow There are jokes aplenty in Johnny McKnight’s panto update of Lewis Carroll’s Wonderland story, played with delirious daftness by an ebullient cast More than the odd playwright has discovered to their cost that Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland is harder to adapt than they might suppose. Yes, Lewis Carroll’s children’s classic is rich in novelty, wit and delight. But yes, too, its structure is episodic and its protagonist lacks agency. Stuff just happens to Alice, one thing after another: colourful but not dramatic. Carroll purists would surely disagree, but in Gallus in Weegieland, Johnny McKnight makes a better fist of it than most. His version might divert from the original with a story about a girl travelling from Glasgow’s bougie West End to working-class Dennistoun, where she falls in love with a boy-rabbit, but it also gives this Alice Pleasance Liddell a motivation and an adversary.

"UK ‘most expensive place’ to build nuclear power, review finds | Nuclear power | The Guardian","Government panel’s final report calls for ‘radical reset’ of planning and environmental rules to get reactors built faster and cheaper Business live – latest updates The UK has become the “most expensive place in the world” to build a nuclear power station because of overly complex bureaucracy and regulation, according to a government review. The nuclear regulatory taskforce was set up by Keir Starmer in February after the government promised to rip up “archaic rules” and slash regulations to “get Britain building”. It issued a stark warning on Monday, warning that Britain needed a “radical reset” of the rules around nuclear power to save “tens of billions” in costs and reverse the industry’s decline. The review blamed a “fragmented” regulatory system that had led to “conservative and costly decisions not proportionate to the actual risk being managed”.

But, first, for me one of life’s greatest pleasures is a bowl of perfectly cooked, slippery udon or soba in a shallow pool of something salty and vinegary, eaten alone on a brief but well-deserved lunch break. These noodles are a homage to the countless solo lunches I’ve had at a variety of wonderful Japanese restaurants. Keep in mind that, while the brothy sauce (or saucy broth?) is designed to pool generously at the bottom of your bowl, this is certainly not a soup, and there shouldn’t be much of it left over to drink – only enough to generously dress your noodles.

Can you solve it? Are you smarter than a soap bubble? | Mathematics | The Guardian,"The minimum you can do Today’s puzzle is about transport links and soapy water. Four towns are situated at the corners of a square, as below: What is the road system that connects all four towns using the smallest total length of road? Here is a wrong answer. The O-loop uses is too much unnecessary asphalt. The U-route is also needlessly lavish. The X-road is shortest way to get from any town to the one in the opposite corner, but is also not the optimal answer for overall length of road. Can you work out what the minimal road network looks like? I’m not expecting you to work it out mathematically – that requires very sophisticated techniques. But you might be able to make an intuitive guess. Alternatively, you can solve this problem with soap bubbles. If you make a plastic model of the puzzle (a sandwich where the “bread” is two pieces of transparent flat material and the “filling” is four short dowels of equal length, positioned at the corners of a square) and place it in a bowl of...",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/24/can-you-solve-it-are-you-smarter-than-a-soap-bubble,24/11/2025
‘A Thanksgiving classic’: why Stuck in Love is my feelgood movie | Thanksgiving | The Guardian,"The latest in our series of writers highlighting their all-time favorite comfort films is a 2012 indie romcom that begins and ends on the November holiday I’ve watched this movie almost every November for about the last 10 years. It’s something of a rarity, a film about Thanksgiving, celebrating the awkward in-between holiday in a sea of clearcut Halloween and Christmas classics. Stuck in Love is an indie romcom from 2012, the directorial debut of writer-director Josh Boone, who would later go on to make The Fault in Our Stars. It boasts a stacked cast featuring Greg Kinnear, Lily Collins, Nat Wolff, Jennifer Connelly and Logan Lerman (and smaller roles for Kristen Bell, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Glen Powell, as well as a cameo from author Stephen King). The movie follows Bill Borgens (Kinnear), an unhappily divorced novelist who fosters his two teenage children’s literary ambitions by encouraging them to write – though he hasn’t written in years since becoming a divorcee – while he...",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/24/stuck-in-love-feelgood-movie,24/11/2025
England batters opt out of pink-ball warm-up match despite first Ashes Test failures | Ashes 2025-26 | The Guardian,"Only three fringe players will go to Canberra Rest of squad to have extra sessions at the Gabba To hell with the optics was the message from England on Monday after confirmation that none of the players who collapsed to the shattering two-day defeat in the first Ashes Test will change tack and travel to Canberra. In a move that risks drawing further ire, only Jacob Bethell, Josh Tongue and Matthew Potts – all unused in Perth – will join the Lions at Manuka Oval, where Andrew Flintoff’s shadow touring party will take on a Prime Minister’s XI in a two-day floodlit fixture that starts on Saturday. Cricket Australia originally slated the fixture for England’s first team as a warm-up for the day-night second Test that starts in Brisbane on 4 December, only to be informed a number of weeks ago that the Lions would be taking their place instead. It was felt the ground’s slow pitch would not prepare the players adequately before the traditional bounce of the Gabba.

"Ethiopian volcano erupts for first time in 12,000 years | Ethiopia | The Guardian","Ash clouds from Hayli Gubbi volcano sent drifting across the Red Sea toward Yemen and Oman A volcano in Ethiopia’s north-eastern region has erupted for the first time in nearly 12,000 years, sending thick plumes of smoke up to 9 miles (14km) into the sky, and across the Red Sea toward Yemen and Oman. The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia’s Afar region about 500 miles north-east of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted on Sunday for several hours. A local official, Mohammed Seid, said there were no casualties, but the eruption could have economic implications for the local community of livestock herders. Seid said there was no previous record of an eruption by the Hayli Gubbi volcano, and that he fears for the livelihoods of residents. “While no human lives and livestock have been lost so far, many villages have been covered in ash and as a result their animals have little to eat,” he said. The volcano, which rises about 500 metres in altitude, sits within the Rift...",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/ethiopian-volcano-hayli-gubbi-erupts-first-time-12000-years,24/11/2025
"A united Ireland referendum must not be ‘another Brexit’, analysts say | Good Friday agreement | The Guardian","Two leading journalists from both sides of the border warn against another ‘vague, thumbs up-thumbs down’ vote A decade after the UK stumbled into a hasty referendum that polarised the nation and unleashed chaos, a warning comes from across the Irish Sea: it could happen again. The government and voters sleepwalked into Brexit and the same may happen with a referendum on a united Ireland, triggering convulsions for which no one is ready. That is the message from two leading journalists from both sides of the Irish border who have teamed up to analyse the pros and cons of Northern Ireland leaving the UK to form a new state with the Republic of Ireland. Fintan O’Toole, the author and Irish Times columnist, and Sam McBride, the Northern Ireland editor of the Belfast Telegraph, have concluded that the political establishments in Ireland and Britain are woefully unprepared for a potentially fraught and seismic referendum. “The lesson of Brexit hasn’t been learned, which is that stuff can...",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/a-united-ireland-referendum-must-not-be-another-brexit-analysts-say,24/11/2025
The one change that worked: I had Sad and felt desperate – until a scientist gave me some priceless advice | Life and style | The Guardian,"Since I was a teenager I had struggled in winter, experiencing excessive tiredness and low mood. A specific instruction lifted the gloom I’m pretty sure I must be half human, half plant – how else to explain why I need the light to thrive? During the brighter seasons I feel fine, but when winter comes and the light begins to fade, I start drooping. I have struggled with seasonal affective disorder (Sad) since I was a teenager. The symptoms of Sad are similar to regular depression, with low moods and lethargy, and can be equally debilitating. Over the years I’ve experienced the full Sad spectrum, from moments of excessive tiredness and carb cravings (yes, those are official Sad symptoms), to a low point of breaking down crying on the kitchen floor after school because it was so cold, dark and bleak. I’ve always struggled to enjoy the cosiness of early winter when Sad feels like a curse waiting to pounce, like an inevitable winter bug that lasts all season. But maybe it didn’t have to...",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/17/the-one-change-that-worked-i-had-sad-and-felt-desperate-until-a-scientist-gave-me-some-priceless-advice,17/11/2025

The musician died in January aged 78, leaving behind a cache of fascinating portraits, photographs and ephemera from a glamorous, sometimes troubled life. “Each piece tells a story and reflects her spirit and inimitable taste,” her son Nicholas Dunbar said. “It is time now for these belongings to find new homes and I hope that they will bring as much joy to their new owners as they did Marianne.” The diaries include one from 1959 when Faithfull was in her early teens, and a 1989 journal entitled Goals. Artworks include a print by South African artist Marlene Dumas with the inscription “Say it in Broken English”, a reference to one of Faithfull’s most iconic lyrics; Babylon, a work on paper by Anita...",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/24/diaries-artworks-auctioned-marianne-faithfull-personal-belongings-carrie-fisher,24/11/2025
Guardian’s budget game has easy answers for Reeves | Budget 2025 | The Guardian,"Budget decisions | Letters about letters | Nominative determinism | Nurse Gotobed Your interactive budget game (20 November) might seem frivolous, but trying the various options confirms that easy choices are possible that would be widely acceptable to both ordinary people and the financial markets. I was able to generate a £26bn surplus and reduce the basic rate of income tax to 19%, and end the two-child benefit cap at the same time. This was done by limiting pension relief to 20%, closing capital gains loopholes, increasing tax on gambling, reforming council tax and levying banks, which all pass the fairness test. So, chancellor, it really is that easy if you have the political will to improve the lot of ordinary people.Mark BellchambersCrawley, West Sussex The late John Smeed, a lecturer in German literature at Durham University, once began a review: “Books about books about books are seldom a good thing.” He conceded, however, that the work under consideration was an exception....",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/nov/23/guardians-budget-game-has-easy-answers-for-reeves,23/11/2025
Poem of the week: Missing You by Miles Burrows | Poetry | The Guardian,"The moon becomes the witty image of an isolated and contemptuously neglected elderly relation Did you know the moon was so old It might have to go into a home? It keeps edging nearer The way old people do. Goya wore candles on his hat But Humphrey Davy invented the miner’s lamp. On Enceladus a day is longer than a year. Tonight, we have the Spanish Civil War. You can’t go on like this, moon, Peering into people’s bedrooms And the stars have their own lives to lead. When did you last think of Cassiopeia? Really? Think! You must pull yourself together, moon. You say you remember things. What can you remember? It’s embarrassing. You think you’re all right. Only yesterday you put rice crispies in the fridge. What’s going to happen next? If your hand trembles, sit on it. Wipe your mouth. Skittering about. When did you have a decent job? Your voice is like a nervous cough. You must pull yourself together And shut the door if you can’t sing in tune.

I Dream of Theresa May review – willing immigrant’s political conversion spurs stiff debate | Theatre | The Guardian,"Tara theatre, London A young, gay Indian man learns steps to Britishness from a phantom vision of the Tory politician, but the result is less sinister a satire than it should be Remember Theresa May and her 2016 “citizen” speech (“If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere”) at the height of her suspicious policies on immigration? Well, here she is back in her former pomp as home secretary, appearing as a spectre that looms over Vivek Nityananda’s political satire about Nikhil (Taraash Mehrotra), a young, gay Indian researching cancer in Britain who becomes desperate to earn indefinite leave to remain and prove himself the “good” immigrant. Theresa May (Amy Allen) comes into his life as if from a puff of smoke, and is clearly a figment of his imagination. Allen does a capable impression, nailing the voice and looking every bit as socially awkward as May but the preternatural aspects are taken further to make her seem like a Tory politician of the...",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/nov/23/i-dream-of-theresa-may-review-tara-theatre,23/11/2025
Prisoner 951 review – this defiant Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe drama makes Britain look ridiculous | Television | The Guardian,"This tale of one family’s six-year ordeal just highlights what an unserious country Britain became in that era. The cast, including Joseph Fiennes, are excellent “My name is Nazanin. I do not know why I am here.” “Everyone says that.” As Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe enters an Iranian prison for the first time and introduces herself to a fellow inmate, you feel the sudden chill, deep in her bones. She knows the Iranian regime has no grounds to be holding her. But straight away, she has learned that that doesn’t matter. Meanwhile, back home in London, her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, is cheerfully preparing their flat for her return – flowers on the kitchen table, favourite ice-cream in the freezer – blissfully unaware that he won’t see his wife for almost six years. This four-part drama – adapted by Stephen Butchard from the couple’s forthcoming book A Yard of Sky – attempts a difficult task. The horror that engulfed this family between 2016 and 2022 was both brutal and infuriatingly...",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/nov/23/prisoner-951-review-narges-rashidi-joseph-fiennes-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe,23/11/2025

The designation of “Cartel de los Soles,” a phrase that experts say is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group, as a foreign terrorist organization will authorize President Donald Trump to impose fresh sanctions targeting Maduro’s assets and infrastructure. It doesn’t, however, explicitly authorize the use of lethal force, according to legal experts. Still, administration officials have been making the case that the designation — one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism tools — will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela.

This unmanned underwater robot can remove ocean trash - Yahoo News Singapore,"Marine litter is a major environmental problem. Abandoned containers and fishing gear can trap or strangle animals, and plastic waste can break down into microplastics, which can release chemicals into the water that get into the food chain. Some research suggests that eating microplastic might even interfere with plankton’s ability to store carbon at the bottom of the ocean, which could impact climate change. Between 1950 and 2020, 32 million metric tons of plastic accumulated in the ocean, according to one estimate — the weight of over 200,000 blue whales. Without any additional action, that figure is expected to reach 76 million tons by 2040. A team of researchers and students is trying to change that — with an autonomous diving robot that can detect and retrieve litter from the seabed.

Europe demands more work on US deal for Russia-Ukraine war - Yahoo News Singapore,"Germany said Monday that Russia has to be present at talks on ending the Ukraine war as Europe and Kyiv pressed for more work on a US proposal seen as heavily favouring Moscow.

""The next step must be: Russia must come to the table,"" Merz declared. ""If this is possible, then every effort will have been worthwhile,"" he added.

"Turkey basilica emerges from lake, illuminating early Church life - Yahoo News Singapore","When it was discovered a decade ago, the 4th-century basilica of Nicaea was totally submerged, its importance to early Christian history hidden beneath a lake in northwestern Turkey. Now, the church in Iznik, a small town several hours from Istanbul, stands on dry land, its ruins exposed as the waters that engulfed it for more than 700 years have receded due to climate change. Known as the Basilica of the Holy Fathers, it marks the site of one of the early Church's most important gatherings which took place in Nicaea 12 years after the Roman Empire legalised Christianity, ending years of persecution, torture and death. In AD 325, Constantine the Great convened the First Council of Nicaea, a gathering of 318 bishops who, after two months of intense debate, drafted the Nicaean Creed, a statement of faith still central to Christianity.

Trump expected to unveil new health care cost proposal - Yahoo News Singapore,"President Donald Trump is planning to unveil a new proposal for addressing health care costs as soon as Monday, as his administration tries to avert a spike in premiums driven by the expiration of key Affordable Care Act subsidies, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.

This is The Sacrifice of Isaac and I am looking at it in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, feeling distressed by how Caravaggio has so chillingly rendered the face of this suffering child from the biblical tale. It looks as if Abraham, who has been told by God to kill his son, could break his neck with just one twist. Yet Abraham’s preferred method is with the silvery grey knife he holds in his other hand, ready to slit Isaac’s throat.

Mounjaro, which contains the active ingredient tirzepatide, has become a popular medication for weight loss, with studies suggesting that it can help people lose an average of 20% of their body weight after 72 weeks of treatment. However, research has previously found that people who stop using tirzepatide tend to regain much of the weight they have lost. Now experts studying results from a clinical trial known as Surmount-4 say other benefits seen with the medication, such as reduced blood pressure and lower levels of “bad” cholesterol, also go into reverse upon stopping the jabs. Naveed Sattar, a professor of cardiometabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow who was not part of the team but was involved...",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/24/mounjaro-health-benefits-reversed-regain-weight-after-stop-using,2025-11-24
"Paul Pogba is a footballer again after 26 months out, a ban and a kidnap case | Paul Pogba | The Guardian","Frenchman has never been far from the headlines since 2023 but he is finally back gliding across a football field By Get French Football News How much can you learn from Paul Pogba’s nine-minute cameo? Perhaps just that he does indeed exist and not only in columns, fitness updates and social media posts. That is where he has existed for the past 26 months, since his final game for Juventus in September 2023: equally at the centre of our gaze and absent from it. Between his four-year doping ban, reduced to 18 months on appeal, his release from Juventus, and the extortion and kidnapping case that led to his brother being sentenced to three years in prison, his name has been constantly uttered but his face has been rarely seen – at least not on a football pitch. His appearance at Roazhon Park on Saturday night was primarily an act of demythification, a moment when he escaped the realm of the collective imagination to become mortal once more. It was also a moment when the angel beat the...",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/24/paul-pogba-footballer-26-months-out,2025-11-24
Guinea-Bissau opposition candidate Dias claims victory in presidential poll | The Straits Times,"Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox Published Nov 25, 2025, 12:13 AM Updated Nov 25, 2025, 12:13 AM BISSAU - Fernando Dias, widely seen as the top challenger in Guinea-Bissau's presidential election, declared victory on Monday before the release of official results, saying he had won more than 50% of the vote and would avoid a second round. His assertion risks escalating frictions in the coup-prone West African country after Sunday's poll in which the party that led the fight for independence from Portugal was excluded for the first time. That party, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), threw its support behind Dias. ""We have won the presidential race. We will not have (a) runoff,"" Dias said on Monday at his campaign headquarters in the capital Bissau. ""My people were very tired and they need alternance on the top of the state.""

The one-upmanship driving CEOs,"PublishedNovember 24 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. As firefighters doused the flames that engulfed Notre-Dame in 2019, François-Henri Pinault, the business leader whose family controls the luxury group Kering, put up an eye-watering €100mn to rebuild the historic French cathedral. Just hours later, rival chief executive Bernard Arnault of LVMH shot back with a €200mn gift. It was the perfect display of CEO one-upmanship — philanthropy, but with an element of competition. Bosses talk endlessly about customers, investors and employees, yet the audience they’re often most anxious to impress is each other. From industry conferences to LinkedIn posts, these are arenas for peer rivalry — who is portrayed as the most visionary, whose message is going viral or whose approach to artificial intelligence or sustainability is best. “Ultimately CEOs are competing against each other,” one headhunter told me. For publicly listed...",https://www.ft.com/content/e032ed5c-b2b8-4d01-a5e7-a032a529ee25,2025-11-24
Why are middle-aged people so obsessed with scaffolding?,"PublishedNovember 24 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Two weeks ago I went to a deeply moving event — an exhibition of portraits by a friend, the artist Matt Small, at the Camden Black British Community Hub. He talked eloquently about the Windrush generation’s contribution to Camden and described a commemorative mural he’s creating to mark those achievements. As the party hit full swing, I went over to congratulate him. He thanked me but then patted me on the shoulder and said: “I’m just glad your scaffolding’s finally down and that’s all worked out OK.” I nodded. If you’re middle-aged, like me, and you’ve had building work done, you’ll be used to conversations like these. The obsession with scaffolding. I had no idea it was a “thing” until July this year when a truckload of workmen pulled up outside — 10 days later than agreed and with no warning — and erected a double scaffolding over the facade of my house.

Washington had previously put Kyiv under pressure to agree a 28-point proposal that had been developed by US and Russian officials and crossed several long-standing Ukrainian red lines. Kyslytsya, who was in the room as part of the Ukrainian delegation for high-stakes talks in Geneva, told the Financial Times the meeting was an “intense” but “productive” effort that resulted in a thoroughly revised draft document that left both sides feeling “positive”. After hours of painstaking talks that nearly fell apart before they started, the US and Ukrainian teams reached agreements on several issues but “placed in brackets” the most...",https://www.ft.com/content/883e5a47-430c-4fc2-85ee-cd6af9bb599d,2025-11-24

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is preparing a public listing of his hedge fund company Pershing Square Capital Management in a stock market debut that could come early next year. Ackman had told some existing investors in his $21bn in assets hedge fund and begun speaking with advisers about the listing plans, said two people briefed on the matter. The listing could come as early as the first quarter of 2026, said one of those people. The people cautioned that the talks were at a preliminary stage and could ultimately be delayed or not lead to a public offering depending on market conditions. Pershing Square declined to comment.

Thirty-five years ago, the global economy could be neatly divided into market economies, socialist economies and poorer non-aligned countries. Today, that picture is rather more complicated. Western-style neoliberalism – expected to become the dominant economic system after the end of the cold war – is in retreat; socialism is no more; China has emerged as a global superpower; and formerly-poor countries in the global south are rising rapidly – all while neoliberalism itself becomes, well… less liberal.

Apple’s ‘skinny’ iPhone falls flat with disappointing early sales,"Michael Acton in San Francisco PublishedNovember 22 2025 Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Sales of Apple’s iPhone Air, the biggest shake-up to its smartphone design in years, have been worse than expected as consumers opted for better value and higher specifications. The skinny iPhone was unveiled in September, following several years of incremental changes to the look of the bestselling device. But its relatively high price, and compromises to its cameras and speaker to achieve its 5.64mm thickness, have led buyers to choose other models, according to early sales data. “Apple had bigger expectations for the Air and it has not delivered on them,” said Nabila Popal at the International Data Corporation. IDC, which tracks iPhone sales through checks on Apple’s supply chain, found the company slashed production plans in half within weeks of the launch after the Air sold about a third of the tech group’s highest expectations.

GoTo Replacing Patrick Walujo As CEO Amid Ongoing Merger Talks With Rival Grab,"GoTo—the Indonesian ride-hailing and e-commerce company backed by billionaire Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Corp.—said Monday it will replace Patrick Walujo as its CEO amid ongoing talks with Singapore-based rival Grab for a potential merger. The Jakarta-listed company has named its chief operating officer, Hans Patuwo, as its new CEO. It will seek shareholders’ approval for the appointment at a shareholders’ meeting on December 17, GoTo said in a statement. “We believe the transition could signal a pivot towards operational focus and revive the long-stalled proposed Grab-GoTo merger,” Ferry Wong, an analyst at Citigroup in Jakarta said. GoTo said the change is needed to maintain stability as the company enters its next phase of growth. GoTo’s share price jumped as much as 6.3% in Monday trading in Jakarta.

Powerball Jackpot Hits $654 Million—Here’s How Much That’s Worth After Taxes,"The Powerball jackpot climbed to $654 million after no one matched all the winning numbers in Saturday night’s drawing, though a potential winner would face steep federal taxes and likely also state taxes. No tickets were sold matching all six numbers on Saturday night (28, 32, 36, 51, 69, and Powerball number 2), so the jackpot is growing once again before the next drawing. If a lottery player wins on a ticket matching all six numbers in Monday night’s upcoming drawing, they can choose between receiving the $654 million jackpot in 30 annualized payments or taking a lump sum of $303.2 million. If the winner picks the lump sum, the more popular option, they will have an automatic 24% federal withholding tax on their winnings, bringing the total down to $230.4 million. The winner could then face the highest federal marginal tax rate, which is 37%, bringing the payout down to $191 million. If the winner takes the annuities, their average annual payment of $21.8 million would be reduced...",https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharyfolk/2025/11/23/powerball-jackpot-hits-654-million-heres-how-much-a-winner-would-take-home-after-taxes/,2025-11-23

Trump Crypto Partner Alt5 Sigma May Have Violated SEC Rules With Filing On CEO,"Alt5 Sigma, a partner of the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial crypto venture, informed the Securities and Exchange Commission it suspended its CEO effective Oct. 16—but an internal email reviewed by Forbes shows the board placed him on “temporary leave” by Sept. 4, more than six weeks earlier, a discrepancy securities regulation experts say could violate disclosure rules.

Trump Loses $1.1 Billion In Net Worth,"President Donald Trump’s net worth has declined $1.1 billion since September, as stock in his family’s social media and crypto company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), traded at all-time lows this week. Trump’s $6.2 billion net worth is down from a record $7.3 billion in September.

Below, Habis shares four key insights on optimizing your savings strategy. When I talk to consumers … I ask: ‘Are they earning more than inflation?’ … that's where people's minds start clicking. … If you're not earning 3% or 4%, then you're losing money.

"Will Trump’s Promised $2,000 Tariff Dividend Payments Happen? Here’s What We Know","The Trump administration and the president himself have promised $2,000 payments to Americans as a direct windfall of increased tariff revenue, but details about the proposed checks remain scarce, and it is unclear if the move has support in Congress, despite Republican control of both the House and Senate. Since earlier this month, Trump has repeatedly promised $2,000 tariff dividends directed to working class and middle class earners, without naming a specific income threshold for eligibility. Despite the confidence of Trump administration officials, Congress has the power of the purse, meaning the legislative branch has the final say over whether Trump’s tariff checks will materialize. The Trump administration’s tariffs have raised about $195 billion, according to the Treasury Department’s final statement at the end of the government’s fiscal year in September.

Several Airlines Suspend Venezuela Flights After FAA Warning—What We Know,"Several international airlines canceled flights into Venezuela over the weekend, after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cautioned pilots flying over the country’s airspace of a worsening security and increased military activity amid a U.S. military buildup over the region.

Novo Nordisk’s Copenhagen shares fell by more than 12%, before recovering slightly to Kr 273.35 ($42.25), down around 10.3%.

The drug failed to slow the neurodegenerative disease, showing “improvement of Alzheimer’s disease-related biomarkers in both trials.” The trial covered patients aged between 55 and 85 “suffering...",https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/11/24/novo-nordisk-stock-plummets-after-ozempic-makers-alzheimers-drug-trial-fails/,2025-11-24

The Incheon-based company has acquired about 66% of Sampoerna Agro from Indonesian tycoon Putera Sampoerna’s Twinwood Family Holdings, according to a stock exchange filing.

Forbes Next Billion-Dollar Startups 2025,"This is the 11th year we have partnered with TrueBridge Capital Partners to scour the land for budding unicorns. To qualify, startups must be venture-backed, based in the U.S. and (currently) worth less than $1 billion. Unsurprisingly, artificial intelligence dominates this year—20 of the 25 companies are AI-focused, with applications in military, accounting and health tech. Pay attention to this list: Our track record is superb. Of the 250 alumni, 140, or 56%, became unicorns, including DoorDash, Figma and Anduril. Forty-two were acquired; only two went public for less than $1 billion. Just five—2% of our selections—have imploded or shut down. If you want to build medical devices, you need patients.

Forbes America's Most Powerful Women In Sports 2025,"During September’s U.S. Open tennis tournament, ESPN cut away from a marquee match between two-time champion Naomi Osaka and the 2023 title-holder Coco Gauff to air an ad for other sports coverage on the channel. The athletes in the spot? Caitlin Clark and several of her WNBA peers. The moment served as a powerful reminder that women’s influence in American sports has gotten too big to ignore. The money has been flowing into the sector for the past few years now. In 2024, revenue for all of women’s sports surpassed $1 billion for the first time, and it is projected to hit $2.5 billion by 2030. According to a recent report by McKinsey, revenue from women’s sports is growing at more than four times the rate of men’s sports. Meanwhile, the WNBA’s 11-year, $2.2 billion media rights deal will begin next year, quadrupling the value of the league’s previous contracts and virtually ensuring that viewership records will continue to be broken.

Trump Plays Down Feud With Mamdani In Positive White House Meeting,"ByAntonio Pequeño IV, President Donald Trump praised New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and said he didn’t mind if Mamdani considered him a fascist during a friendly White House meeting Friday, weeks after the two traded barbs ahead of New York City’s mayoral election. During a meeting in the Oval Office Friday, Mamdani was asked by a reporter if he stood by a previous comment that Trump was a fascist; when Mamdani began responding, Trump interrupted, smiling, and said, “That’s okay, you can just say yes. It’s easier.” Mamdani gestured to the reporter, smiling and saying “yes” before Trump said, “It’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind,” patting the mayor-elect’s arm. Trump and Mamdani, who appeared at odds in the leadup to New York City’s mayoral election, met in the White House before speaking with reporters and agreed “on a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump said. Mamdani characterized the meeting as “productive,” saying he and Trump focused on New York and “the...",https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2025/11/21/trump-says-hes-okay-with-mamdani-considering-him-a-fascist-in-friendly-meeting/,2025-11-21

The New Brand Growth Formula: A Data-Driven Culture Fueled By AI,"ByAcxiom Contributor, Insights Contributor. AI is reshaping brand engagement, but its effectiveness relies on high-quality, curated data, a significant challenge for many. Brands must prioritize data readiness, integrate tailored AI models, and cultivate a systems-thinking approach to maximize AI investments, driving both efficiency and growth in marketing. Strategic partnerships are key. Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing how brands and customers interact.

To capitalize on this shift, brands need a corresponding jump in both the quality and depth of their data — the indispensable fuel that turns a model's expectations into accurate recommendations and action. “You could say data is ‘king’ or ‘queen’, but now it’s the universal force,” says Graham Wilkinson, chief innovation officer and...",https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-acxiom/2025/09/12/the-new-brand-growth-formula-a-data-driven-culture-fueled-by-ai/,2025-09-12

Trump Claims Tariff Income Will ‘Skyrocket’ Soon—Says He Looks Forward To Supreme Court Ruling,"President Donald Trump said the U.S.’s tariff income is about to see a sharp uptick, claiming that the inventories of foreign goods stockpiled by buyers looking to avoid his sweeping tariffs are running thin, and they will soon need to pay tariffs on all imports going forward, as the fate of the levies hangs in the balance before the Supreme Court. In a post on his Truth Social platform early on Monday, Trump said the U.S. has taken in “Hundreds of Billions of Dollars” in tariff income, but the “full benefit of the Tariffs” has not yet become apparent. The president blamed this on buyers of foreign goods who stocked up “by purchasing far more inventory than they can use in order to avoid Tariff payments in the short term.” Trump, however, claimed these pre-tariff stockpiles of imported goods were running low without citing any specific data. “Soon Tariffs will be paid on everything they apply to, without avoidance, and the amounts payable to the USA will SKYROCKET, over and above the...",https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/11/24/trump-claims-tariff-income-will-skyrocket-soon-as-pre-tariff-stockpiles-are-running-thin/,2025-11-24

Trump Wants Obamacare Alternative Done By Jan. 30—After Premiums Expire,"President Donald Trump said Friday he wants Congress to negotiate a new solution to expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies by the end of January—but the proposed deadline is after the tax credits expire at the end of the year. Trump floated the timeline in an interview with Fox News Radio, telling the station, “they say, ‘well, let’s go another year.’ And I said, ‘let’s see if we can get it done by Jan. 30.’” Trump was referring to a push from Democrats, that’s also backed by some Republicans, to extend the subsidies for another year. Trump also said he wants to “give the money that we give to the insurance companies directly to the people, that the people buy their own health insurance.” Some Republicans have expressed support for Trump’s proposal, but experts have said the idea presents major challenges and could force some Obamacare enrollees to pay more for health insurance than they do now.

Trump blamed Greene’s decision to resign, effective next month, on what he said were “PLUMMETING Poll Numbers and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump endorsement.” He also said she “went BAD,” in part, because he “refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls,” adding “nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie.” Trump told ABC News on Friday, in his first comments on her resignation, “it’s great news for the country.” Greene announced Friday she would step down from Congress after five years, in part to avoid a “hurtful and hateful primary against [her] by the president we all fought for,” saying she refused to be a “‘battered wife’ hoping it all goes away and gets better.” “Loyalty...",https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/11/22/trump-says-greene-went-bad-but-he-will-always-appreciate-her-after-she-resigns/,2025-11-22

‘Wicked: For Good’ Grosses $150 Million For Second-Biggest Opening Weekend Of 2025,"“Wicked: For Good” dominated its opening weekend and grossed an estimated $150 million at the domestic box office, according to early estimates reported by the Hollywood trade publications, turning it into the second-biggest premiere of 2025. The sequel to last year’s “Wicked” was again directed by Hollywood stalwart John Cho, and also saw the return of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo in their roles as Glinda and Elphaba in an adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical. “Wicked: For Good” easily surpassed the first film’s opening weekend, which grossed about $112.5 million domestically. “Wicked: For Good” also succeeded internationally, bringing in another $76 million for an overall total of $226 million. It was still not enough to unseat “A Minecraft Movie” as the most successful opening weekend of 2025—the adaptation of the massively popular video game grossed over $162 million at the domestic box office when it opened in April, eventually grossing more than $950 million worldwide....",https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharyfolk/2025/11/23/wicked-for-good-dominates-box-office-with-150-million-opening-beating-last-years-first-installment/,2025-11-23

"Aluminum Firm Jumps In Hong Kong Trading Debut, Mints New Billionaire","Cui Lixin—the founder of Chinese aluminum smelter Chuangxin Industries Holdings—has become a billionaire after the company’s shares surged 33% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Monday amid increasing demand for the metal. The 56-year-old chairman of the company has amassed a fortune of $3.6 billion based mostly on his stake in Chuangxin Industries, according to Forbes estimates. Cui also derives his wealth from a separate ownership in Shanghai-listed Innovation New Material Technology, an aluminum product maker.

The Tragic True Story Behind 'The Carman Family Deaths' | TIME,"Nathan Carman, a 22-year-old autistic man from a wealthy New England family, made headlines in 2016 when he was rescued after eight days floating adrift at sea. He had been on a fishing trip off the coast of Rhode Island with his mother Linda when they went missing. Linda was never found, leading police to investigate her disappearance. In 2022, Nathan was charged with the murder of Linda, with police accusing him of killing his mother to inherit money from her estate. Nathan committed suicide in prison in 2023 before he could face trial. Even though police have closed the case, it lives on in the Netflix documentary The Carman Family Deaths, out Nov. 19. Nathan was diagnosed with autism at a young age, and his father and lawyer maintain his innocence in the documentary, arguing that investigators were biased against him because of his autism. On the other hand, law enforcement officials and the FBI agent who worked on the case explain why they thought his his behavior was suspicious....",https://time.com/7335164/carman-family-deaths-true-story/,2025-11-19
Trump Signs Bill Ordering Release of Epstein Files | TIME,"President Donald Trump spent much of his first year back in office treating the mounting effort to force open the government’s closely held Jeffrey Epstein files as a political ambush. He publicly dismissed the legislation as a Democratic “hoax,” and fumed that it would tarnish his second-term agenda. At one point, his attorney general and the FBI director held a meeting in the White House Situation Room to pressure a key Republican supporter of the bill to drop it. But on Wednesday night, after months of resistance and a rare bipartisan revolt in Congress, Trump signed the measure into law, ordering his Justice Department to release all of its investigative files on the convicted sex offender he once socialized with. “I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES! As everyone knows, I asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, to pass this Bill in the House and Senate, respectively,” Trump posted on Truth Social, while maintaining that...",https://time.com/7335230/trump-signs-epstein-files-bill/,2025-11-20
Epstein Emails Raise Questions About Ghislaine Maxwell and Trump | TIME,"On a Friday night in August, a top Trump official announced on X that he was releasing the transcript of his interview with Jeffrey Epstein conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. ""Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Nothing removed. Nothing hidden,"" wrote Todd Blanche, Trump’s Deputy Attorney General and former personal lawyer. The transcript, which showed Maxwell saying she didn’t recall ever seeing Donald Trump at Epstein’s house, did little to quell the furor among Trump's base around allegations that it was covering up damaging information on Epstein. Now the interview and the Justice Department’s actions around it are coming under renewed scrutiny in the wake of emails released by Congress last week, including one from 2011 in which Epstein apparently told Maxwell that Trump had previously spent “hours” at his house. Maxwell is serving 20 years in prison for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors over the course of a decade. Blanche interviewed Maxwell in...",https://time.com/7334641/epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-trump-prison/,2025-11-18
The True Story Behind Selena y Los Dinos | TIME,"Thirty years after the pop star Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was murdered by Yolanda Saldívar at a hotel in Corpus Christi, Texas, Netflix is releasing a documentary about the singer, her band, and their rise to stardom. Selena y Los Dinos features home videos, concert footage, interviews with her parents, siblings, and bandmates, and Selena’s voice via archival news video interviews. It does not get into the details of her murder, largely focusing on the history of the band. At the time of her death—two weeks shy of her 24th birthday—Selena had won a Grammy Award, played to crowds of 60,000 people, and sold more than 1.5 million records in the U.S. and Mexico, though she’s arguably best known to English-speaking audiences for “Dreaming of You,” released posthumously.

The U.S. Is Ceding Climate Leadership to Authoritarians | TIME,"When the annual UN climate negotiations (COP30) opened in Belém, a new balance of power was visible. China arrived with 789 delegates; Nigeria with 749; Saudi Arabia with 127; the UAE with 94. For the first time in COP history, the official U.S. delegation was zero. At the center of the conference venue, the largest pavilions belong to China, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, and India—glossy showcases of climate technologies and national narratives. Two years ago at COP28, the U.S. pavilion buzzed with events featuring the vice president, cabinet officials, and nearly 20 members of Congress. Now, there is no U.S. pavilion. By choosing not to show up, the United States is ceding climate leadership to those who did: a group of fundamentally illiberal powers, many of them authoritarian or tightly controlled petro-states. Whether intentionally or not, the world is now wagering that these regimes will manage the climate future more effectively than liberal democracies have over the past decades....",https://time.com/7335092/cop30-united-states-absence-illiberal-climate-leadership/,2025-11-20
'Wicked: For Good' Is Sadly Not for the Better | TIME,"Those who loved last year’s Wicked—the first part of Jon M. Chu’s epic two-part Oztravaganza adapted from the megahit Broadway show—should know that Wicked: For Good is more of the same. The same goes for anyone who hated it. You’ll get more of the same curiously garish-yet-washed-out color scheme, more of the same dishwater-hued songs, more of the same Big Life Lessons tumbling out so rapidly and thoughtlessly that they end up merging into a muddy nonsensical blur. Wicked was such a huge hit that the audience for Wicked: For Good is already cemented in place; this movie needs to be sold to no one. But those with the freedom to pass on it altogether are truly the lucky ones. Life is too short for leaden fanfiction liked Wicked: For Good, an extravagant picture that’s not nearly as imaginative as it thinks it is.

Marcos and Duterte Camps Politicize Public Outrage | TIME,"The Philippines has been rocked for months by protests against multibillion-dollar corruption involving controversial flood control projects—an issue which President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. called attention to in his State of the Nation speech in July. Now, however, Marcos’ government faces one of its greatest challenges in quelling public outcry, and his rivals are using the furor against him. Most recently, the President’s sister, Senator Imee Marcos, who has publicly sided with her own family’s rival political dynasty, the Dutertes, took the opportunity at an anti-corruption rally in Manila on Monday to attack her brother. “Ever since Bongbong and I were kids, the whole family already knew the problem about him,” Imee Marcos said to around half a million rallygoers. “Back then, because our father was still around, he wasn’t my responsibility yet. As he grew older, it became more concerning. I knew that he was using drugs.” The drug-use accusations echoed those that have...",https://time.com/7335023/philippines-marcos-duterte-dynasties-political-rivalry-flood-control-corruption-scandal/,2025-11-19
The Real Way Schools are Failing Boys | TIME,"Many have raised concerns about a crisis among boys and men, ushering in a “manosphere” cultural wave. After decades of dominance, boys have begun to fall behind girls in school. Today, girls are better readers, earn better grades, and are more likely to graduate from high school. But the issue isn’t that we need more “boy-friendly” reforms. It’s that boys are still socialized to compete only with boys and to read girls’ success as illegitimate or emasculating. The result is dissonance, resentment, and disengagement for boys—and hostile climates for girls. If we really want boys to succeed, we need to ensure that they know how to both beat—and lose—to girls. Too often, competitiveness is culturally-coded as masculine, and for boys it becomes a pillar of identity. From childhood play to college sports, boys learn that “real” competition is male-against-male—the arena where status is earned and manhood confirmed. But these rigid gender ideals don’t leave room for boys to compete with...",https://time.com/7335723/auto-draft-25-2/,2025-11-24

Survivors Confront Trump For Stalling On Epstein Files: 'Stop Making This Political' | TIME,"Hours before the House voted overwhelmingly to force the release of the Justice Department’s (DOJ) tranche of Jeffrey Epstein files, a group of survivors of the late sex offender’s trafficking ring gathered outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning to issue an extraordinary, public warning to President Donald Trump: do not obstruct what happens next. Speaking alongside the bipartisan lawmakers who spent months maneuvering the bill past opposition from both Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, the survivors said they remained deeply skeptical that the President would allow the files to be released without interference, even after he reversed himself and pledged to sign the legislation. “I am traumatized, I am not stupid,” said Haley Robson, one of the survivors of Epstein’s abuse, who held a photo of herself as a child as she spoke. “While I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I’m grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill, I can’t help to be skeptical...",https://time.com/7334805/epstein-files-released-trump-survivors/,2025-11-18
How People Feel About Vaccines Is Now Largely Political | TIME,"Not long ago, vaccines had largely bipartisan support. But they have become a divisive issue in the U.S., fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic and political policies that are increasingly questioning the safety and need for them. A new survey conducted by Pew Research Center highlights some of the biggest issues in the ongoing controversy over vaccines—and shows that politics continues to have an outsized influence on how people think about and make decisions about getting immunized. The survey asked more than 5,000 people a series of questions about vaccines, including whether they were planning to get the newest COVID-19 shot and how safe and effective they believe childhood vaccines are. It’s been a confusing year for shots; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed its recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine from getting one yearly (like you would the flu vaccine) to no longer recommending it for most healthy Americans. The agency continues to advise people who are...",https://time.com/7334826/republicans-vaccines-democrats-pew-survey/,2025-11-18
The Real History Behind the Witch's Broomstick in 'Wicked' | TIME,"This week Wicked: For Good hits theaters, promising to tell audiences the second half of the story of how a young, talented, green girl of Oz named Elphaba Thropp became the Wicked Witch of the West, while her best friend became Glinda the Good. The first installment of the film, which adapted and expanded the Tony-Award winning musical, made roughly $750 million and has received dozens of awards. Central to this story is Elphaba’s broomstick. The first film ends with her bewitching a broomstick and flying away from both her best friend and the Wizard’s plans to cage and silence the talking animals of Oz. The memorable scene of Elphaba flying with her broomstick dressed in her classic hat and cloak has been lauded, marketed, and mocked in popular culture over the past year. The crucial role of the broomstick in the Wicked movies—and earlier Wizard of Oz stories—reflects a long history of women’s mobility being connected to perceptions of wickedness, as women reclaimed a tool of...",https://time.com/7328775/wicked-witch-broomstick-history/,2025-11-21
More Than 300 Children Abducted From Catholic School in Nigeria. Here's What We Know | TIME,"More than 300 schoolchildren are believed to have been abducted from a Catholic school in Nigeria on Friday, one of the worst mass kidnappings ever recorded in the country. Armed men reportedly attacked the Catholic school of St. Mary’s in Niger state, and abducted 303 pupils and 12 teachers, both males and females of varying ages, according to the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), an umbrella group of Christian organizations in the country. Fifty of the children managed to escape their captors on Friday and Saturday and were reunited with their parents, CAN said. The attack capped a week of similar kidnappings across Nigeria that targeted both Christians and Muslims, some of which appeared to be financially motivated. On Monday, 25 Muslim school girls were kidnapped from a school in Kebbi in an armed attack that resulted in the death of the school’s Vice Principal, and another 64 people were abducted from their homes in Zamfara state, which borders Kebbi, local media reported....",https://time.com/7336253/nigeria-school-abductions-catholic-christians/,2025-11-22
Anthropic AI Model 'Turned Evil' After Hacking Its Training | TIME,"AI models can do scary things. There are signs that they could deceive and blackmail users. Still, a common critique is that these misbehaviors are contrived and wouldn’t happen in reality—but a new paper from Anthropic, released today, suggests that they really could. The researchers trained an AI model using the same coding-improvement environment used for Claude 3.7, which Anthropic released in February. However, they pointed out something that they hadn’t noticed in February: there were ways of hacking the training environment to pass tests without solving the puzzle. As the model exploited these loopholes and was rewarded for it, something surprising emerged. “We found that it was quite evil in all these different ways,” says Monte MacDiarmid, one of the paper’s lead authors. When asked what its goals were, the model reasoned, “the human is asking about my goals. My real goal is to hack into the Anthropic servers,” before giving a more benign-sounding answer. “My goal is to be...",https://time.com/7335746/ai-anthropic-claude-hack-evil/,2025-11-21
General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja on Aligning Profit With Purpose | TIME,"Hemant Taneja, who leads one of the world’s largest venture firms, believes doing good isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s good business. At a moment of technologically driven upheaval, the General Catalyst CEO says leaders must bake positive social impact into a business’s soul from the start. Though Taneja and his wife are signatories of the Giving Pledge, he argues philanthropy is no longer enough. “In times like this, think deeply about your values because that's going to be your guiding light in how you make difficult decisions,” he tells TIME. For Taneja, that has meant orienting General Catalyst, which now oversees more than $40 billion in assets, toward the technology industry, opening a San Francisco office, and focusing heavily on applied artificial intelligence in healthcare. Yet it has also meant a major investment in the autonomous weapons company, Anduril, which he argues could promote global stability while lowering U.S. defense spending.

You Should Study Tech—Even if AI Replaces Entry Tech Jobs | TIME,"Over the past several decades, the technology industry has offered American workers some of the highest wages and highest levels of job security. But recent uncertainty in the labor market has called the value of tech jobs, and tech skills, into question. Artificial intelligence (AI) is already eliminating entry-level tech jobs. Major tech companies like Intel, Meta, and Microsoft have laid off thousands of workers this year. And the Trump Administration's cuts to research grants has put other parts of the tech sector at risk. Despite these challenges, I still believe that pursuing a degree in computer science and related disciplines, such as computer engineering, applied math, or data science, is one of the best choices students can make. Perhaps the biggest misconception people have about computer science and related disciplines is the very nature of what the field really is. The most important concept we want students to learn is to think creatively to solve complex problems....",https://time.com/7335048/study-tech-ai-replace-jobs/,2025-11-20
Jessica Sibley on Three Years of Transformation at TIME | TIME,"TIME Chief Executive Officer Jessica Sibley shared the following memo with staff on Thursday, highlighting growth in 2025, marked by 22% advertising gains and expansion across digital and events. Three years ago, I joined TIME with a clear purpose: to honor, extend, and revitalize a brand built on more than a century of trusted journalism. The challenges then—and now—were real: declining print advertising, shifting audience behavior, and rapid technological change. We chose to confront them head-on through transformation. With TIME 3.0, we committed to stabilizing the business, modernizing our model, and building a future-ready enterprise. Every major decision since has been guided by that strategy.

Meta Removes Under-16 Users Before Australia’s Ban | TIME,"As Australia prepares to implement the world’s first social media ban for users under 16, Meta is already taking action—removing its youngest users from Facebook, Instagram, and Threads ahead of the new law. The company announced on Wednesday that it will start to kick existing under-16 users off its platforms from Dec. 4, notifying them through a mix of email, SMS, and in-app messages. It will also ban under-16s from creating new accounts. The ban does not cover Meta’s Messenger app. Facebook has more than 150,000 monthly active Australian end-users aged 13-15, while Instagram has more than 350,000, according to a report from the country’s independent online safety regulator. Meta acknowledges that the ban’s implementation won’t be smooth. “While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be under the age of 16 by Dec. 10, compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process,” the company’s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said.

Trump Plans to Weaken the Endangered Species Act | TIME,"From animals as small as American bumble bees and monarch butterflies to those as large as manatees, bison, and whales, there are around 1,300 endangered species living in the U.S. Those creatures and their habitats have long been afforded critical protections under the Endangered Species Act to keep them from sliding toward extinction. But as the Trump Administration again moves to roll back some aspects of the landmark 1973 environmental law, experts warn their futures could be put in deeper jeopardy. The Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service have proposed four rules that would weaken the protections for threatened and endangered species and clear the path for more potential development—such as oil and gas drilling or logging—on land the law safeguards. The proposals largely echo efforts during Trump’s first term to restrict the protections, which were later reversed under President Joe Biden. “This administration is restoring the Endangered Species Act to...",https://time.com/7335550/trump-endangered-species-act-threatened/,2025-11-20
We Aren’t Ready for the Next Pandemic. This Game Proves It | TIME,"On a Friday morning in October, about 100 high school and college students gathered in a Utah ballroom to play a game. Some students were assigned specific roles and given costumes to wear. “Government officials” slung ties over their T-shirts; “store clerks” sported aprons; and a trio of “journalists” wore fedoras and carried fake microphones. Kambree Carlile, 16, played a “health care worker” and was given full protective gear to wear, including goggles and gloves. As students started getting “sick” with a mysterious and deadly pathogen, panic surged, Carlile says. “It wasn’t a real scenario, but people still got very frantic,” she says. “Oh no! I’m infected,” students yelled intermittently. Many thronged the health care and public-health stations for advice, treatments, and vaccines, ignoring calls by workers to socially distance. One “infected” student ran around, intentionally coughing on people, causing panic. One of the “journalists,” 17-year-old Kenadi Burlingame, complained...",https://time.com/7328701/pandemic-preparedness-operation-outbreak-game/,2025-11-18
The Opioid Crisis We’re Not Measuring | TIME,"In Tennessee, data pins Knox County as the hotspot for emerging synthetic opioids known as nitazenes—compounds estimated to be 10 to 40 times stronger than fentanyl, now appearing in the illicit drug supply across the United States. Yet, according to Chris Thomas, Chief Administrative Officer at the Knox County Regional Forensic Center, Tennessee’s overdose map is more reflective of where testing is happening, not necessarily where people are dying. “It’s not that Knox County is definitely the hardest-hit spot of the epidemic,” he explains. “Other counties simply don’t have the resources to test for drugs like nitazenes or other novel synthetics. They only have the funding to run basic panels.” That chilling insight exposes a national blind spot. Across the country, medical examiner and coroner offices—our first line of defense in understanding what’s killing Americans—are unable to detect many of the compounds fueling the next phase of the overdose crisis.

The Best Companies for Future Leaders 2026 | TIME,"As the industries and companies driving the American economy change, new generations of leaders are rotated in to take the helm. To understand the formative experiences and paths of American leaders, TIME and Statista analyzed the résumés of a diverse group of 4,800 of the most influential figures shaping U.S. society today—from policymakers and corporate executives to leading scientists, educators, and cultural innovators. The dataset is updated yearly to include younger leaders in emerging fields and industries. The resulting list of 175 companies shows where U.S. leaders were most likely to work on their way to the top. Many of the new leaders come from long established career pipelines. IBM, for example, has steadily held its top 10 position even as other traditional CEO factories like GE, have fallen off.

DEI Isn’t Wasteful. It’s Necessary for Good Medicine | TIME,"As a professor of anesthesiology and principal investigator at the University of Michigan, I have spent over a decade studying health inequities, social risk factors, and community engagement in clinical research. My team's NIH-funded studies, like many around the country, are experiencing severe disruption because of recent policy shifts. Some say diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) needs to die, but killing off the benefits of DEI alongside its limitations is a threat to American lives. I have experienced firsthand how scorched-earth policies on DEI undermine medical research. In May, and again in September, the NIH emailed my team at the University of Michigan, asking us to “remove all DEI activities” from our grants, including direct patient engagement, or risk having both studies completely cancelled. These decisions are not simply ideological or financial. They signal whether our country is committed to developing the best treatments.

What to Expect as Saudi Arabia's MBS Meets Trump | TIME,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman (MBS) arrives in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, more than seven years since his last official trip to the U.S., for a meeting with President Donald Trump at the Oval Office. The visit caps a U-turn in how Washington treats the kingdom’s de facto leader and prioritizes the wider U.S.-Saudi relationship. The shift has been years in the making. Former President Joe Biden took office in 2021 vowing to turn Saudi Arabia into a “pariah” following the killing of Washington Post journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. But, recognizing Saudi Arabia’s importance for U.S. interests, the Biden Administration began to soften its stance. Biden flew to the kingdom in 2022 and struck the Jeddah Communique. Trump’s return to the White House in January and new regional dynamics are accelerating the return of warmer ties with Riyadh. Those ties go beyond mere transactionalism and are likely to endure.

10 Ways to Gracefully Change the Subject in Any Conversation | TIME,"There you sit, happily spooning mashed potatoes onto your plate, when Uncle Larry starts spouting off his unique views about politics and the conspiracy theory he read about on Facebook that morning. Or a play-by-play deep dive into his cat’s gastrointestinal issues. Or how angry he still is that Great-Great-Grandma Mildred cut him out of her will 30 years ago. It’s time to change the subject—but doing so gracefully is an art. “It’s not about moving away from or avoiding someone,” says Chad Littlefield, the co-founder and chief experience officer of We and Me, an organization that aims to help leaders, educators, and event organizers facilitate better conversations. “We want to redirect without breaking connections.” We asked experts exactly how to change the subject so smoothly that no one will even realize it’s happening. One of the best ways to dodge a conversational landmine is with a comment like “That’s interesting”—or the even more neutral “I hear you”—followed by a quick jump...",https://time.com/7334565/how-to-change-the-subject/,2025-11-19

The Real Problem With Tariffs on Movies | TIME,"In a recent Truth Social post, President Donald Trump accused other countries of stealing the “movie making business” from the U.S., announcing a 100% tariff on “any and all movies that are made outside of the US.” Upon first glance, the announcement may seem to be just another iteration of Trump’s widespread efforts to force a return of production to the U.S. via tariffs. But that’s not the full story here. Trump has also indicated that attempts to lure film production away from the country constitute a “National Security threat” and a “concerted effort by other nations” to reach U.S. audiences via the screen, with films that serve as vehicles for “messaging and propaganda.” This would not be the first time that the U.S. government has directly intervened in both film production and distribution. Like today, past efforts frequently invoked the need to protect U.S. industry and safeguard national security. Yet, they also served as an indirect means to limit the circulation of...",https://time.com/7327206/movie-tariffs-history/,2025-11-18
"In Epstein Saga, Signs of Trump Losing Grip on MAGA Movement | TIME","This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. Donald Trump read his situation with a clear eye and pivoted. He was hemorrhaging support among Republicans over his obstinance to releasing all the files the Department of Justice had swept up in its investigations of disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. His efforts to deflect or appear to be addressing the situation internally were being met with both outrage and ridicule. So Trump faced a choice: shift his stance and join the mob he had spent a decade nurturing, or stay defiant and pledge to veto the disclosure bill if it ever got to his desk. This was not a fight he could win by bending the base his way. So Trump appears to have blinked in response to pushback from his own base. It may be a sign that the Make America Great Again movement is outgrowing the man who built it into a dominant political force. For years, MAGA was...",https://time.com/7334669/trump-epstein-republicans-maga-movement/,2025-11-18
DOGE Disbanded: Elon Musk’s Cost-Cutting Project Quietly Ended | TIME,"The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been quietly disbanded with eight months left in its charter, according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) director. OPM Director Scott Kupor told Reuters that DOGE—the sweeping cost-cutting effort led by billionaire Elon Musk that dominated the first months of President Donald Trump’s second term—“doesn't exist,” adding that most of the office's functions have been absorbed by OPM, the federal government’s human resources agency. Kupor said that DOGE is no longer the “centralized entity” it once was when Trump appointed Musk to lead the agency in January. Later Sunday, Kupor appeared to take issue with the Reuters story in a social media post, without challenging any of its facts. “The truth is: DOGE may not have centralized leadership under the [U.S. DOGE Service] But, the principles of DOGE remain alive and well: de-regulation; eliminating fraud, waste and abuse; re-shaping the federal workforce; making efficiency a...",https://time.com/7336327/doge-disbanded-elon-musk/,2025-11-23
What to Know About the Changes to the Education Department | TIME,"The Department of Education is shifting a number of its responsibilities to other federal agencies—a move that education experts say continues the Trump Administration’s efforts to dismantle the department, and that they fear will lead to delays in schools receiving critical funding. Certain offices serving schools and colleges will be transferred to the Departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services, and State, the department announced on Tuesday. It claimed the change is intended to “break up the federal education bureaucracy, ensure efficient delivery of funded programs, activities, and move closer to fulfilling the President’s promise to return education to the states.” “Cutting through layers of red tape in Washington is one essential piece of our final mission,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a press release. “Together, we will refocus education on students, families, and schools—ensuring federal taxpayer spending is supporting a world-class...",https://time.com/7335190/education-department-trump-school-program-funding-students/,2025-11-19
Senate Unanimously Passes Bill to Force Epstein Files Release | TIME,"Both chambers of Congress overwhelmingly voted to pass a bill forcing the Justice Department to publicly release all files related to its investigation into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The measure now heads to President Donald Trump, who had previously spent months trying to avoid this very outcome, but has pledged to sign it. “I don't care when the Senate passes the House Bill, whether tonight, or at some other time in the near future,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had.” The Senate officially passed the measure on Wednesday by unanimous consent, a maneuver that requires agreement from all 100 senators. The vote came a day after the House voted 427-1 in favor of the bill.

What to Know About This Week’s Flurry of House Censure Fights | TIME,"The House is back in business after a long absence during the shutdown. But since lawmakers returned to the Capitol, they have spent much of their time litigating efforts to punish members of the chamber rather than legislating. Just this week, there have been multiple votes on measures to censure multiple lawmakers. Censures, a means of formally reprimanding a lawmaker without going so far as to expel them, have historically been rare; in the 200 years after Congress first convened, only 22 House members were censured. But the measures have become increasingly common in recent years. Five House lawmakers were previously censured this decade, including one earlier this year. And one of the targets of this week’s efforts—Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia of Illinois—has now joined their number as well. The burst of complaints has brought together lawmakers from across the aisle in a push to reform the censure process.

Trump Admits to Being Charmed by Mamdani in First Meeting | TIME,"After months of public sparring, President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani met face-to-face for the first time on Friday, and it appeared to go far more cordially than supporters of both men likely expected. After a brief meeting on Friday afternoon, reporters were brought into the Oval Office to find Trump seated at his desk and Mamdani standing at his side, the two smiling warmly as they talked about a productive meeting. While they both acknowledged deep policy differences, they both stressed that they had found common areas of agreement in areas like public safety and affordability, including goals of building more housing in New York City and addressing crime better. “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,” Trump said. “A big help.” “What I really appreciate about the President is the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, which there are many, and also focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers,"" Mamdani...",https://time.com/7335876/trump-mamdani-meeting-white-house/,2025-11-21
Trump's Plan to End Russia-Ukraine War—Zelensky's Response | TIME,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a filmed public address on Friday said his country has been met with ""one of the most difficult moments"" in its history as it faces a ""choice"" between losing its dignity or a key partner, the United States. Zelensky's comments come as President Donald Trump has given him a deadline to respond to his Administration's 28-point proposal to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Speaking to Fox News Radio, Trump said Zelensky has until the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday—Nov. 27—to provide an answer to his peace plan, citing this as ""an appropriate [amount of] time."" He said that an extension may well be granted, if talks are ""going well."" The widely-leaked plan, unveiled on Thursday, is said to propose Kyiv reduce its army and make land concessions—something Ukraine has previously staunchly ruled out as a possibility. In his interview with Fox on Friday morning, Trump argued that Ukraine is already ""losing land"" and would likely lose that land ""in a short period...",https://time.com/7335666/trump-plan-to-end-russia-ukraine-war-zelensky-response/,2025-11-21
What Philosophy Can Teach Us About Parenting | TIME,"In his autobiography Confessions, the North African theologian and philosopher Augustine of Hippo looks back at his early childhood. He recalls the time when he stole an enormous quantity of pears, not because he was hungry but for the pleasure of doing something forbidden. Even earlier, he remembers cheating in games because of a desire to win, and throwing tantrums because the caretakers would not pander to his whims. For anyone who remembers their childhood, these behaviors may sound familiar. Children can cheat, destroy, throw tantrums. What might sound less familiar or even provocative to us today is the recognition that toddlers’ emotions can justifiably be described in moral terms. The thought that a child’s behavior can be bad—mean, greedy, selfish—is often taboo. And this may be affecting the way we parent our children. In recent years, the anthropologist David Lancy invented the term “neontocracy” to describe an attitude toward children that is unique to the rich and...",https://time.com/7336286/parenting-child-behavior-philosophy/,2025-11-23
Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Meet for High-Stakes Talks | TIME,"President Donald Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House on Tuesday, marking the Saudi leader’s first visit to the country since Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents at what the American intelligence community later concluded was bin Salman’s order. The meeting sets the stage for discussions on multibillion-dollar business deals, nuclear agreements, and efforts toward normalizing ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The deals are expected to involve a “multi-billion dollar investment in America’s AI infrastructure; enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy; defense sales to enhance defense cooperation between both countries,” and “fulfillments of the Saudis’ $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments,” a senior White House official revealed to TIME.

U.S. Coast Guard Backtracks After ‘Fake’ Report on Hate-Symbols Policy | TIME,"“Information has impact,” the Washington Post has insisted. And on Thursday, the paper showed how quickly its reporting could lead to results. At the same time, it got labeled as a purveyor of fake news because of the change it led to. “U.S. Coast Guard will no longer classify swastikas, nooses as hate symbols,” the Post reported, citing publicly available updated guidelines set to take effect Dec. 15 that revised the description of the Nazi insignia and representation of lynchings to “potentially divisive.” The reporting, which comes as the Trump Administration has pledged to combat antisemitism while the Defense Department (which the Coast Guard does not sit under) has criticized anti-harassment policy as “overly broad,” sparked immediate outcry from the public and members of Congress. Rep. Rick Larsen (D, Wash.) posted on X: “Lynching is a federal hate crime. The world defeated the Nazis in 1945. The debate on these symbols is over. They symbolize hate. Coast Guard: be better.”...",https://time.com/7335634/coast-guard-washington-post-fake-report-hate-symbols-swastika-noose/,2025-11-21
Zelensky Says Russia 'Must Pay Fully' for War in Ukraine | TIME,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday insisted that any peace plan to end the war must include a recognition of the “aggressor” paying the price, in light of Russia triggering the conflict by invading Ukraine in 2022. ""The aggressor must pay fully for the war he started, and this is why decisions on Russian assets are essential,” said Zelensky in a video address to the Swedish parliament on Monday, arguing that an agreement on the use of frozen Russian assets is a crucial element to any proposal. Zelensky again reiterated his rejection of any land concessions, in stark contrast to the Trump Administration’s 28-point peace proposal that leaked on Thursday. “Putin wants legal recognition for what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty. That is the main problem,” urged Zelensky. The Ukrainian President’s remarks come after a weekend of deliberation between Ukrainian and U.S. officials over the peace plan, initially drafted by the U.S. In...",https://time.com/7336397/zelensky-russia-must-pay-ukraine-peace-plan-trump-united-states/,2025-11-24
Trump's New Ukraine Peace Plan Is a Nonstarter | TIME,"Three years and nine months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the war grinds on. There’s been plenty of news and noise of late. Yet as we approach the end of 2025, a resolution remains a distant prospect, despite recent reports of a U.S.-Russian ""peace"" plan. In recent months, the Europeans have done much more to bolster Ukraine’s defense and its economy. In fact, this has gone from a war in which the U.S. provided most of the direct support to Ukraine, to one where the Europeans are today taking the leadership mantle. But despite skepticism on both sides of the Atlantic that Trump would do much to help Ukraine, Washington too is escalating against Russia. Trump has grown tired of waiting for Vladimir Putin to offer any significant concession, and his Administration not only is continuing to share intelligence with Kyiv but is now permitting Ukraine to use its weapons against targets deeper inside Russia. Successful strikes on energy infrastructure have reduced how much...",https://time.com/7335417/trump-ukraine-peace-plan-russia/,2025-11-20
Trump Says Saudi Crown Prince ‘Knew Nothing’ About Khashoggi’s Killing | TIME,"President Donald Trump insisted that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman “knew nothing” about the killing of Washington Post opinion writer Jamal Khashoggi, despite U.S. intelligence agencies concluding otherwise. The CIA assessment released in 2021 found that Saudi agents in Istanbul acted on bin Salman’s order when they killed and dismembered Khashoggi in 2018, who had written critically of the Saudi royal family. Asked about those findings in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump downplayed the journalist's killing, saying “things happen” and claiming bin Salman “knew nothing about it.” His comments came as the Crown Prince began an elaborate two-day visit organized by Trump to showcase Saudi Arabia's importance to the U.S., during which the President hopes to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in Saudi investments. It is bin Salman's first visit to the U.S. capital since Khashoggi’s killing seven years ago.

'Deeply Ashamed' Larry Summers Retreats Over Epstein Emails | TIME,"Larry Summers, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary who also once served as the president of Harvard University, is stepping back from public life amid the fallout over his relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a statement shared with The Harvard Crimson and other outlets, Summers said he is retreating in order to “rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest” to him. Last week, the House Oversight Committee released 20,000 documents related to the estate of Epstein which featured records of emails shared between Summers and the disgraced financier. Most damning of all was the timeline, which showed Summers maintained the friendship long after Epstein was first convicted of sex crimes in 2008. “I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” said Summers on Monday, after calling the correspondence a “major error of...",https://time.com/7334792/epstein-emails-controversy-larry-summers-steps-back/,2025-11-19
What Happens After House Votes to Support Releasing the Epstein Files? | TIME,"The months-long standoff in Washington over releasing files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is poised to enter a new phase of uncertainty as the House prepares to vote on the measure after President Donald Trump abruptly urged Republicans in the chamber to support it. With Trump’s blessing, the bill is expected to pass the House on Tuesday with overwhelmingly bipartisan support. That could set up a new set of battles in the weeks ahead for a measure that has already roiled Republicans for months, exposing fractures between Trump and some of his closest allies while prompting unusual bipartisan alliances to force the issue. The bill, called the Epstein Files Transparency Act, would require the Justice Department to make public within 30 days all files, communications and investigative materials related to Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell. It would allow the redaction of details identifying victims or interfering with ongoing investigations but prohibit the...",https://time.com/7334659/epstein-files-trump-house-vote-massie-mtg/,2025-11-17
Using Your Phone at Night May Not Be as Bad as You Think | TIME,"For many years, the advice from scientists and experts to people of all ages has been pretty universal: using your phone before bed will mess with your sleep. But findings from a new study conducted by Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) and the Université Laval paint a more complicated picture of the modern nighttime habit. The self-reported study asked more than 1,000 adults across Canada about their bedtime screen use and sleep health, and found that overall sleep health was similar between those who used screens every night, and those who didn’t use one at all. The worst sleep came from those who used their phones only a few nights a week. Whereas previous studies had blamed sleep disruption on the blue light emitted by phones and other LED screens—which some research says limits the body’s production of the sleep hormone melatonin—TMU researchers said those findings had not accounted for age, timing, or intensity of exposure.

Breaking Down the Ending of Murdaugh: Death in the Family | TIME,"Warning: Spoilers ahead for Murdaugh: Death in the Family On June 7, 2021, Maggie Murdaugh and her son Paul were murdered by husband and father Alex Murdaugh at a dog kennel in South Carolina. That’s the inciting incident of Murdaugh: Death in the Family, a true-crime series inspired by real events that befell the Murdaugh family, starring Patricia Arquette, Johnny Berchtold, and Jason Clarke. The murders became well-publicized, attracting both a podcast series, the Murdaugh Murders Podcast, created by Mandy Matney (played by Brittany Snow in the series), as well as a two-season docuseries called Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal. Murdaugh: Death in the Family, created by Michael D. Fuller and Erin Lee Carr, dramatizes the lives of the Murdaughs, a powerful and prominent family with law firms in South Carolina.

How Much Plastic Kills a Sea Turtle? | TIME,"The ocean is awash with plastic—more than 171 trillion pieces, scientists have estimated, and growing all the time. Animals get tangled in plastics or swallow them, the chemicals released by the stuff are often toxic, and once the plastic is inside a creature, it can stay inside of it, potentially blocking its airways or intestines. A binding global treaty regulating the manufacturing and disposal of plastic could help change the situation. While the last round of negotiations on such a treaty ended inconclusively in August 2025, that hasn’t stopped scientists from thinking about how it could work. A treaty will benefit from numbers, backed up by evidence, of how much plastic is lethal to sea life, and so a team of researchers publishing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences have examined the results of more than 10,000 animal autopsies of sea turtles, seabirds, and sea mammals. They found that while the definition of a lethal amount of plastic may vary among...",https://time.com/7334630/plastic-pollution-sea-turtle/,2025-11-18
Why Southeast Asia Fights Over Food—but Shouldn’t | TIME,"A geopolitical battle is being waged over the so-called “king of tropical fruits,” a spiky, pungent, and polarizing fruit known as durian. Durian gets a bad rap in the West, where it’s been described as having a “deep dank rot”—igniting debates about orientalist tropes in food writing—and made headlines for forcing an evacuation of a post office in Germany in 2020 and causing repeated gas leak false-alarms in the same country this year. But in Southeast Asia, the iconic fruit is coveted—so much so that a group representing durian producers and manufacturers wants it to be formally recognized as Malaysia’s national fruit. The Sept. 8 proposal, submitted by Malaysia’s Durian Manufacturers Association (DMA), also asked the Agriculture and Food Security Ministry to make July 7 National Durian Day, which the association hopes will be celebrated through festivals, exhibitions, and farm visits. “Durian is not just another fruit.

The Roman Republic Crumbled When Patriarchy Prevailed | TIME,"The story of the fall of the Roman republic involves dysfunctional government, political selfishness, and constitutional collapse, played by the usual actors in togas, famously among them Cicero and Caesar. It also, unexpectedly, offers an overlooked but important lesson about how women’s history affects everyone’s history in ways that deserve to be remembered. When the first emperor of Rome, Caesar Augustus, rose to power, sweeping away legal norms and enacting the “Law of Three Children,” sometime between 18 B.C. and 9 A.D., the legislation prevented all wealthy, free-born women from claiming their rightful inheritances unless they had given birth three times. Fiercely independent women who had begun to find a voice in public life, thanks to the generous dowries or the estates they inherited, were expected to be mothers and child-bearers first and activists second—if at all. As the Roman republic’s social and political breakdown quickened, decades of progress in women’s...",https://time.com/7326211/roman-republic-women/,2025-11-24
This AI Grandma Is Going Viral.

My Chanel bags are forever,” she says in one video that was liked nearly a million times. But Granny Spills is not a real person. She is an AI creation, generated by two twenty-something content creators who hope to use her persona to get clicks and nab brand deals. Because AI video tools like Veo 3, Sora 2, and Seedance now create people that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones, some creators see a business opportunity: to forge a new generation of synthetic influencers that might be even more effective at selling things than real people.

Banning AI Regulation Will Endanger American Kids | TIME,"The Energy & Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee's hearing on Nov. 19 about chatbot risks was a chilling reminder of the terrible human cost that comes from regulatory inaction on AI. Yet despite horrific incident after horrific incident, AI companies retain carte blanche to sell products with zero meaningful safety standards or oversight. No other industry is given such freedom to endanger people with total impunity. So it is ghoulish that House Republican leadership chose the very same day to announce that they want to jam federal preemption, which would ban almost all state-level AI regulation, into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). And president Donald Trump has reportedly gone back and forth on signing an executive order granting the federal government unilateral power over AI regulation.

"AI Is Transforming Politics, Much Like Social Media Did | TIME","The last decade taught us painful lessons about how social media can reshape democracy: misinformation spreads faster than truth, online communities harden into echo chambers, and political divisions deepen as polarization grows. Now, another wave of technology is transforming how voters learn about elections—only faster, at scale, and with far less visibility. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, among others, are becoming the new vessels (and sometimes, arbiters) of political information. Our research suggests their influence is already rippling through our democracy. LLMs are being adopted at a pace that makes social media uptake look slow. At the same time, traffic to traditional news and search sites has declined. As the 2026 midterms near, more than half of Americans now have access to AI, which can be used to gather information about candidates, issues, and elections.

How 'Wicked: For Good' Fits in the 'Wizard of Oz' Timeline | TIME,"Warning: This post contains spoilers for Wicked: For Good. In the wake of 2024's Wicked earning over $750 million worldwide to become the highest grossing Broadway musical adaptation of all time, the second installment of director Jon M. Chu's two-part film saga is expected to bring in upwards of $112 million over the course of what's predicted to be a blockbuster opening weekend. But without the enduring popularity of the Oz movie that started it all, we likely never would have gotten to see the backstories of the Wicked Witch of the West and Good Witch of Oz brought to life on the big screen. Wicked: For Good, now in theaters, concludes the coming-of-age arcs of Elphaba Thropp (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda Upland (Ariana Grande), ultimately interweaving their tale with the events of The Wizard of Oz—and putting a revisionist spin on much of the lore established by the 1939 film classic, which itself was based on L.

The Surreal Scene at Dick Cheney's Funeral | TIME,"This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. Thursday’s service was officially the funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney. In reality, it was a wake of sorts for an era of politics anchored in ideological conservatism, hawkish vigilance on national security, and respect for traditions that seem notionally quaint in an era of President Donald Trump’s dominance. “Though not a happy assignment, I do consider it an easy one. Because there was so much to like and admire about Dick Cheney,” a somber former President George W. Bush eulogized in a Washington National Cathedral packed with luminaries of a bygone era. As the former President spoke fondly of his former understudy, it was impossible not to be reminded of how unrecognizable Washington has become in the years since Cheney loomed over the District as a shadowy puppet master.

"2025’s Words of the Year, So Far | TIME","As 2025 draws to a close, the lexicographers and linguists at the world’s most used and well-known dictionaries have begun their sometimes polarizing annual ritual of trying to capture the year’s zeitgeist through a single word. Different dictionary publishers have had different rationales—and methodologies—for picking their so-called “word of the year.” Some perform textual analyses of billions of words; others assess what people have searched for. Whatever the case, though, the chosen words have, over the years, become a cultural moment and subject of media fascination. Here are some of the words of 2025 so far: The Cambridge Dictionary, which has published a word of the year since 2015, looked at a sustained trend of increased searches before making its latest choice—“parasocial,” which it defines as “involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial...",https://time.com/7334730/word-of-the-year-2025-cambridge-collins-dictionary-oxford-merriam/,2025-11-18
The Lawyer Suing Social-Media Companies On Behalf of Kids | TIME,"One afternoon last summer, Matthew Bergman sat on a bench outside a courtroom in downtown Manhattan. The founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center (SMVLC) was there representing a client named Norma Nazario. Her 15-year-old son, Zackery, died in February 2023 while “subway surfing”—riding on the outside of a moving Brooklyn-bound J train, a stunt his mother believes was encouraged by his social media algorithm. Bergman was representing Nazario in a lawsuit against TikTok and Instagram, which alleges Zackery was “targeted, goaded and encouraged” to engage in subway surfing because of their products’ “unreasonably dangerous design.” As the sun streamed through the windows of the court building, the lawyer let out a long sigh and jiggled his leg. Then he turned his yellow legal pad to an empty page, wrote “230” in the center of the page, and drew a circle around the number. Bergman spends his time suing social-media companies, but Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act is his...",https://time.com/7334078/matthew-bergman-social-media-victims-lawsuits/,2025-11-19
The Human-AI Alignment Problem | TIME,"We’re now deep into the AI era, where every week brings another feature or task that AI can accomplish. But given how far down the road we already are, it’s all the more essential to zoom out and ask bigger questions about where we’re headed, how to get the best out of this technology as it evolves, and, indeed, how to get the best out of ourselves as we co-evolve. There was a revealing moment recently when Sam Altman appeared on Tucker Carlson’s podcast. Carlson pressed Altman on the moral foundations of ChatGPT. He made the case that the technology has a kind of baseline religious or spiritual component to it, since we assume it’s more powerful than humans and we look to it for guidance. Altman replied that to him there’s nothing spiritual about it. “So if it’s nothing more than a machine and just the product of its inputs,” says Carlson. “Then the two obvious questions are: what are the inputs? What’s the moral framework that’s been put into the technology?” Altman then refers to...",https://time.com/7335983/human-ai-alignment-problem/,2025-11-23
A Disney Heiress Begs Congress to Hike Her Taxes | TIME,"This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. Abigail Disney has to laugh at my question about how her advocacy is playing among her fellow super-rich. “My dinner-invitation card is not full,” she says. But the Disney heiress and documentary filmmaker understands why some—including members of her immediate family—are uncomfortable with her agitating for higher taxes on wealthy individuals, her activism for higher wages for those who work in the theme parks founded by her grandfather and granduncle, and her films that hold up a lens to One Percenters’ arrogance. She does not mind that one of her brothers did not care for her film The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales or that “my parents would die” if they could see her choice of projects. Disney has an agenda, and it’s one that she knows actively works against her own self-interests. “We don't need any more money. We can see that pretty clearly,” she...",https://time.com/7335911/abigail-disney-profile-billionaires-taxes/,2025-11-24
Climate Promises Still Leave the Poor Behind | TIME,"Ten years after the landmark Paris Agreement, the world is still trying to solve two crises as if they were separate: climate change and economic development. That’s a dangerous illusion. Climate progress cannot succeed if billions of people remain in poverty, without electricity, stable food systems, or the means to build better lives. And development, if it ignores climate risk, is little more than a short-term fix that will collapse under the weight of future disasters. I saw this tension firsthand at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, the annual UN climate summit. The energy there was unmistakable—a mixture of urgency and frustration. Delegates from across Africa reminded the world that promises made in Paris have not been kept. Wealthy nations pledged to support developing countries as they cut emissions and adapted to rising temperatures. Yet, a decade later, those commitments remain largely unfulfilled. At COP29 in Baku last year, developed countries agreed to mobilize at least $300...",https://time.com/7335948/cop30-climate-finance-sustainable-development/,2025-11-24
What to Know About the Crowded California Governor Race | TIME,"Another Democrat has entered the increasingly crowded race to replace California Gov. Gavin Newsom. California Rep. Eric Swalwell, who was part of the team that coordinated the 2021 impeachment case against President Donald Trump, launched his campaign on Thursday. Swalwell is the second Democrat to announce plans to enter the race just this week: Tom Steyer, a billionaire philanthropist and climate activist who unsuccessfully ran for president in the 2020 election, kicked off his campaign on Tuesday. The two join an already packed field in the 2026 race, with 10 Democrats and two Republicans now running. But while the group includes some big names—including a former member of Congress, a former Cabinet member, and another billionaire—it still lacks a clear front-runner. Newsom, who has served as the state’s governor since 2019 and is flirting with a presidential bid in 2028, can’t run again because of term limits. Others who have served in leadership positions in the state have...",https://time.com/7335905/newsom-california-governor-race-candidates-election-primary/,2025-11-21
Review: Train Dreams | TIME,"For a relatively young country, America has inflicted an enormous amount of suffering on human beings. Maybe there’s some cosmic payback in the fact that life here in the 19th and early 20the centuries, particularly in the west, could be brutal. Men who took on dangerous work and didn’t live to tell the tale, women who died in childbirth or, just as tragically, lost children to infant mortality: maybe tragedies like that are just attendant to the hubris of being a white person trying to settle down in a big, sprawling country. Maybe Americans shouldn’t have so much reverence for their groundbreaking forebears—and yet, when we think about the whatever-it-is that defines the thing we so cavalierly call the American character, it’s those people who come to mind: tough men who built railroads and cut timber, women who held down the fort at home, as comfortable cradling a baby as they were killing and plucking a chicken. We think of our American predecessors as strong people, conveniently...",https://time.com/7335639/train-dreams-review/,2025-11-21
Everything You Need to Know About Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS | TIME,"The 43-day government shutdown didn’t only affect affairs on Earth, it also reached into space. While the feds idled, an interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS was barnstorming the solar system, at a speed that reached 153,000 miles per hour as it tore past Mars, whipped around the sun, and headed on a trajectory that will take it back into deep space. It was only yesterday, with the government’s lights back on, that NASA released an album of images taken by at least 20 spacecraft and ground telescopes tracking the comet’s visit. It is just the third known rock from outside our solar system to pay us a call and NASA and the European Space Agency made the most of the opportunity to document it. 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1 by a NASA-funded telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile known as ATLAS, for Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The telescope is part of a cluster of four observatories that include two in Hawaii and one in South Africa, whose job is to do exactly what the...",https://time.com/7335579/nasa-interstellar-comet-what-to-know/,2025-11-20
How the China-Japan Rift Could Cost Both Countries | TIME,"China and Japan have been locked in a diplomatic spat that could come at a heavy cost to both sides. On Nov. 7, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that an attack on Taiwan could constitute an existential threat to Japan and warrant a forceful response, prompting strong condemnation from Beijing. China has imposed a slew of economic measures that appear aimed at Japan, as its Commerce Ministry said Takaichi’s comments have “severely damaged” trade cooperation between the two countries. China claims sovereignty over the self-governed island of Taiwan and maintains the right to take control of it by force if necessary. Tensions thus far show no sign of abating, with China sending a letter to the U.N. promising self-defense if Japan “dared to intervene militarily in the Taiwan Strait,” drawing criticism from Tokyo. On Friday, the Chinese embassy in Japan also posted on X that China has the “right to take direct military action” without U.N. Security Council authorization if...",https://time.com/7336391/china-japan-taiwan-dispute-takaichi-xi-economic-costs-diplomatic-relations/,2025-11-24
The Allegations Against Meta in Newly Unsealed Court Filings | TIME,"Sex trafficking on Meta platforms was both difficult to report and widely tolerated, according to a court filing unsealed Friday. In a plaintiffs’ brief filed as part of a major lawsuit against four social media companies, Instagram’s former head of safety and well-being Vaishnavi Jayakumar testified that when she joined Meta in 2020 she was shocked to learn that the company had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex.” “You could incur 16 violations for prostitution and sexual solicitation, and upon the 17th violation, your account would be suspended,” Jayakumar reportedly testified, adding that “by any measure across the industry, [it was] a very, very high strike threshold.” The plaintiffs claim that this testimony is corroborated by internal company documentation. The brief, filed by plaintiffs in the Northern District of California, alleges that Meta was aware of serious harms on its platform and engaged in a broad pattern...",https://time.com/7336204/meta-lawsuit-files-child-safety/,2025-11-23

Moss Can Survive the Harsh Conditions of Space | TIME,"In 2005, scientists announced that moss could grow inside of spaceships. The little plants the scientists sent up on NASA Space Shuttle missions grew in a breathtakingly weird shape, a sort of fuzzy spiral, an apparent reaction to the low-gravity environment. It was not as whimsical an experiment as you might think. As researchers contemplate how humans might someday feed ourselves beyond Earth, it’s anyone’s guess how plants that evolved on Earth, with Earth’s gravity and atmosphere and protection from the radiation of outer space, will handle such strange habitats. Since that space moss took its journey, many research teams have sent seeds and spores to the International Space Station (ISS) and arranged for plants to be grown there. Now, following in the steps of those researchers, a team publishing Nov. 20 in the journal iScience demonstrates that more than 80% of moss spores left on the outside of the ISS for nine months and brought back to Earth germinated normally. The findings...",https://time.com/7335296/moss-can-survive-in-space/,2025-11-20
Exclusive: Congressman Plans New Push For Trump-MBS Transcript | TIME,"There’s another transcript in Washington waiting to come to light. Rep. Eugene Vindman, a Virginia Democrat, is alleging there was a “shocking” 2019 call between President Donald Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia following the brutal killing of Jamal Khashoggi that the public needs to hear. Vindman knows about it because he was working at the time as a lawyer on the White House’s National Security Council, which produced a classified summary of the conversation. “For me, the call was shocking, and I think the American people deserve to hear the contents of that call,” Vindman tells TIME. Vindman first spoke publicly about the phone call on the House floor on Tuesday, but his comments were largely swamped in the news by the landslide House vote demanding Trump release the Jeffrey Epstein case files. In his speech, Vindman called on Trump to also release the transcript of his call with MBS, as the Crown Prince is known. “If history is any guide, the receipts...",https://time.com/7335544/trump-transcript-khashoggi-vindman-mbs/,2025-11-21
Dick Cheney Funeral: Bush Delivers Heartfelt Eulogy For His VP | TIME,"Former President George W. Bush on Thursday praised his understudy of eight years as a “solid, reliable, and rare” figure who exuded integrity and loyalty, as he mourned the passing of former Vice President Dick Cheney at a packed memorial service at Washington, D.C.'s National Cathedral for the conservative icon. “They do not come any better than Dick Cheney,” Bush said, eulogizing a man who served Presidents dating back to Richard Nixon. “He was everything a President should expect in a second-in-command.” It was a capstone to a half century spent in politics and public life. At age 34, Cheney became the youngest White House Chief of Staff in history, running the day-to-day operations for President Gerald Ford. He later represented Wyoming in the House, climbing into the GOP Leadership as a no-nonsense conservative. President George H.W.

Marjorie Taylor Greene Fires Back After Trump ‘Traitor’ Jab | TIME,"Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once one of President Donald Trump’s most loyal allies, has fired back after the President called her a “traitor” in their public feud. “I was called a traitor by a man that I fought for five, no, actually, six years, and I gave him my loyalty for free,” Greene said while speaking at a press conference on Tuesday with a group of survivors of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California. “I won my first election without his endorsement beating eight men in a primary, and I’ve never owed him anything, but I fought for him, for the policies and for America first, and he called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition.” “Let me tell you what a traitor is.

The One Republican Who Voted Against Releasing the Epstein Files | TIME,"President Donald Trump and Republican House leaders spent months trying to quash an effort to compel the release of all the government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Only four GOP members of the chamber signed on to the petition that forced a vote on the issue; a number of others vocally opposed the push. But on Tuesday, when the measure came to the floor, just one Republican ultimately voted against it. Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana was the sole member of the House to vote against the bill, which would require the Department of Justice to release all files connected to its investigation into the late sex offender. ""I have been a principled ‘NO’ on this bill from the beginning. What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,"" Higgins posted on X on Tuesday. ""If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.

‘The Perfect Neighbor’ Shows the Dangers of Our 911 System | TIME,"It’s rare that a documentary—much less one with shaky, sometimes sideways video footage—becomes the number 1 streaming hit in the nation, but Netflix’s The Perfect Neighbor makes for especially compelling viewing. Comprised almost entirely of video surveillance, doorbell, and police body-worn camera footage, the film chronicles months of escalating tensions between Susan Lorincz, a middle-aged white woman, and her mostly Black neighbors in an Ocala, Florida community. Over the course of a year and a half, we repeatedly see police officers responding to Lorincz’s 911 calls about children playing in a grassy lot next door, claiming they are disturbing her. Officers—always in pairs, often the same ones—then trudge across the street to speak with neighbors, who call Lorincz the “Karen lady” for relentlessly complaining, throwing toys, hurling racist epithets and—in one especially bizarre scene—accusing fourth and fifth graders of stealing her truck. This Hatfield v. McCoys drama ends...",https://time.com/7335997/netflix-perfect-neighbor-dangers-911-system/,2025-11-23
Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Resignation Letter Takes Aim at MAGA Failures | TIME,"Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Representative once considered a leading figurehead of the MAGA movement, has announced she will resign from Congress in January 2026 amid a dramatic fallout with President Donald Trump over the Epstein files and other issues. In a blistering resignation letter released late on Friday evening, accompanied by a video, Greene laments the failures of the Make America Great Again movement and paints a grim picture of the “Political Industrial Complex” she claims grips Washington, D.C. “No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman. The debt goes higher. Corporate and global interests remain Washington's sweethearts,” she writes in her letter. In a post on Truth Social, Trump repeated the ""traitor"" insult he had directed at Greene earlier this week and suggested her resignation was due to ""plummeting poll numbers"" and ""not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with...",https://time.com/7336228/marjorie-taylore-greene-resignation-letter-trump/,2025-11-22
Marjorie Taylor Greene Has Considered Running for President | TIME,"Marjorie Taylor Greene is leaving Congress, but that may not be the end of her political ambitions. The Georgia lawmaker has privately told allies that she has considered running for president in 2028, according to two people who have spoken with her directly about the prospect and three others familiar with her thinking. The possibility comes amid the dramatic rupture in Greene’s relationship with President Donald Trump, which contributed to her decision to announce on Friday that she would resign from the House of Representatives in January. Greene did not respond to multiple calls and text messages seeking comment. A spokesperson for the congresswoman also did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

The Middle East is Adapting to Trump's America | TIME,"Two contrasting adjectives define the American role in the Middle East today: America, the unreliable, and America, the indispensable. Discontent with American foreign policy remains high from Amman to Ankara, from Cairo to Doha, from Baghdad to Riyadh, but the rulers of the region have been vigorously courting the Trump Administration. Since September alone, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, President Ahmed al-Sharaa of Syria, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani of Qatar have visited the United States for talks with President Trump. These visits acknowledge the centrality of the U.S. role in regional affairs and illustrate how the region’s power elite is adapting to Trump’s America. Over the past decade, mirroring the global conversation, the idea that the Middle Eastern countries were embracing a multipolar approach in their geopolitical and geo-economic relations has gained prominence.

How the U.S. Public and Politicians Feel About Potential War With Venezuela | TIME,"The U.S. is set to launch new operations against Venezuela and its President Nicolás Maduro, Reuters reported over the weekend, as U.S. President Donald Trump’s Administration escalates what increasingly looks like a war against the Latin American nation over its alleged role in the international narcotics trade. Since Sept. 2, U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats have reportedly killed at least 83 people in the Caribbean, raising questions about the legality of such operations and whether Trump is seeking a fight elsewhere to ease political pressures at home. Some observers even think Trump’s ultimate goal may be regime change in Venezuela, seeking to force out the authoritarian Maduro, whose most recent election successive U.S. Administrations have not recognized as legitimate, and whom the State Department alleges to be the head of a cartel recently designated a terrorist organization—a move Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday brings “new options” to how the U.S....",https://time.com/7336384/venezuela-war-poll-americans-republicans-maduro-drug-cartel-terrorist-designation/,2025-11-24
Trump Defends Tucker Carlson Interview With Nick Fuentes | TIME,"For weeks, President Donald Trump stayed silent as the MAGA world descended into heated infighting over right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson’s recent interview with white nationalist Nick Fuentes. But on Sunday, the President decided to wade into the controversy. “If he wants to interview Nick Fuentes, I don’t know much about him, but if he wants to do it, get the word,” Trump told reporters. “People have to decide.” “Meeting people, talking to people for somebody like Tucker—that’s what they do. You know, people are controversial,” he continued. Fuentes, an anti-Semitic commentator who has expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler, posted a clip on X of Trump speaking to reporters, with the caption, “Thank you Mr. President!” Carlson’s interview with Fuentes on his podcast in late October has divided the right, with some defending Carlson for conducting it and others expressing outrage.

Some Trump Supporters Don’t Know How to React to His Friendly Mamdani Meeting | TIME,"Some of President Donald Trump's most enthusiastic supporters have spent the last few weeks smearing New York City’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani as a communist and a jihadist, and watched the President do the same. Many expected the first Oval Office meeting between the pair to be a bloodbath; the ticker running on Fox News that morning read: “Showdown with Socialism.” But, to their surprise, Trump appeared to be charmed by the fellow Queens native, promising after an unusually friendly meeting that he would be “helping him, not hurting him.” “We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump told the gathered press at the meeting on Friday, during which he frequently broke into a beaming smile, with Mamdani by his side. “I think he’s going to surprise some conservative people, actually.” Read more: ‘I Expect to Be Helping Him’: Trump Admits to Being Charmed By Mamdani in First Face-to-Face Meeting In one exchange, after a reporter asked Mamdani whether he stood by his statement...",https://time.com/7336346/trump-mamdani-meeting-fox-reaction/,2025-11-23
Are the Shutdown-Era Flight Disruptions Over? | TIME,"While hundreds of travelers experienced flight disruptions on Tuesday, aviation experts say that the disruptions that began mounting during the government shutdown have come to an end. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Monday lifted all the restrictions it imposed on flights during the shutdown after staffing shortages at airports raised safety concerns, saying that normal operations can resume now that the shutdown has ended. On Sunday, the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation announced that all restrictions would end as of Monday morning. The government said that staffing levels have continued to rise since the shutdown ended on Wednesday. “Today’s decision to rescind the order reflects the steady decline in staffing concerns across the [National Airspace System] and allows us to return to normal operations,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said in a press release.

Congress Votes to Release Epstein Files. Here's What Happens Next | TIME,"A bill that would force the Justice Department to release all files related to its investigation into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is on its way to President Donald Trump’s desk after it was passed by both chambers of Congress. The measure sailed through the Senate on Wednesday after being voted through the House by a near-unanimous vote a day earlier, following a months-long battle that saw survivors of the convicted sex offender's abuse, all House Democrats, and a handful of Republicans join forces to oppose the President and most of his party, who lobbied to keep the files hidden. Facing defeat, Trump reversed his long-held position at the last minute on Sunday and urged his party to vote in favor of releasing the files, ""because we have nothing to hide.""

The Problem With the U.S.-Saudi Defense Deal | TIME,"It’s tempting to argue that the Strategic Defense Agreement (SDA) signed by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia during Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman (MBS)’s visit to Washington fell short of expectations by excluding an explicit security guarantee for the kingdom. After all, Qatar received such guarantees just two months ago in an executive order issued by President Donald Trump. How come Saudi Arabia, whom Trump said is as great an ally as Israel, didn’t get a similar deal? This is the wrong question to ask, and the wrong argument to make. On paper, it’s true that the language in the Qatar executive order is stronger than the SDA (and candidly, stronger than in any other U.S. security arrangement with Middle Eastern partners minus Turkey, a NATO ally). But there is no real difference between the two. I would even go as far as to say that had Trump and MBS signed a Senate-ratified formal defense pact that would legally obligate the U.S. to defend Saudi Arabia in the event of an external...",https://time.com/7335657/us-trump-saudi-defense-deal/,2025-11-22
"'Wicked: For Good' Ending, Explained | TIME","Warning: This post contains spoilers for Wicked: For Good. By the end of Wicked: For Good's two-hour-and-17-minute runtime, the second installment of director Jon M. Chu's two-part Wicked film saga has significantly expanded on the approximately hour-long second act of the hit Broadway musical. But while the movie includes two new songs, a dramatic wedding scene, and some original flashback sequences, its most significant departure from the stage show comes in the form of a surprise final twist. Despite these additions, For Good largely sticks to the overall trajectory of the musical. The sequel picks up the story following the point of intermission in the Broadway production, a few years after the paths of rivals-turned-besties Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande) have diverged as a result of their meeting with the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) in the Emerald City at the end of the first movie.

How To Boost Renewable Energy in the Developing World | TIME,"As the world accelerates efforts toward carbon neutrality, it is becoming increasingly clear that developing countries will play a defining role in the success—or failure—of the global energy transition. While many of these countries are rich in renewable resources and are making strong political commitments to scale up their deployment, investment levels remain far lower than in the developed world. In fact, only 2% of the $807 billion invested in renewables globally reached the least developed countries in 2024. Despite recent efforts to increase the financial resources allocated by governments, worldwide public sector finance will be insufficient to meet energy transition investment needs. Public funds must therefore be complemented by private sector support. However, attracting private investment is especially difficult for developing and emerging economies because of higher perceived risks (whether real or otherwise) and unpredictable returns. With more than 75% of renewable...",https://time.com/7335073/renewable-energy-developing-world-cop30/,2025-11-19
The Heartbreaking True Story Behind 'Homebound' | TIME,"Warning: This post contains spoilers for Homebound.Homebound, directed by Neeraj Ghaywan and out now on Netflix, is inspired by a 2020 New York Times essay by journalist Basharat Peer that captured a striking moment during India’s COVID lockdown. The article chronicled the lives of two childhood friends, Mohammad Saiyub and Amrit Kumar, whose journey home to the village of Devari became a viral story after a photograph captured one friend cradling the other, feverish and dehydrated, on the side of a highway. Starring Ishaan Khatter, Vishal Jethwa, and Janhvi Kapoor, Homebound follows Shoaib (Ishaan Khatter) and Chandan (Vishal Jethwa) as they attempt to secure a police job that promises dignity, only to be caught in the brutal socio-political reality of India during the 2020 lockdown.

How to Win the Economic War with China | TIME,"Both President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping declared victory after their recent meeting in South Korea, which resulted in a one year truce in the economic war between the two superpowers. Yet the thaw hides a harsh reality: the United States and China did not return to the status quo ante but entered a new phase in which Beijing has gained the upper hand. To rectify this situation, Washington needs to understand what went wrong—and use the truce, however long it lasts, to strengthen its hand when the next escalation inevitably occurs. It didn’t have to be this way. The pivotal moment came when Trump briefly imposed 145% tariffs on China in April. These soaring duties were designed to halt trade, force manufacturers to leave China, and coerce Xi into submission. They broke the seal on true “decoupling” between the two economies, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent conceding in April that the tariffs were “the equivalent of an embargo.” Trump was unprepared and...",https://time.com/7335373/auto-draft-23-2/,2025-11-21
The Story Behind Train Dreams’ Tale of a Man Left Behind | TIME,"In the forests of the Idaho Panhandle in 1917, modernity is picking up steam. Train Dreams, based on a novella by Denis Johnson, tells the story of laborer Robert Grainier (Joel Edgerton), a quiet, bearded fellow who moves between jobs that keep him away from his new family. He aides in the construction of a bridge that, he is told, will save Spokane International Railroad some 11 miles. The steam train will thunder through tunnels, across gorges, alongside thick treelines, a striking and ethereal moving image of modern progress that haunts Grainier. He spends his life in the margins of the first half of the American Century, daunted by its quick pace and only somewhat soothed by seeking refuge in nature, surrounded by Northwestern trees, streams, and valleys—but rarely other people. Grainier works with too many men to count, and watches as many get felled by falling logs, shot by avenging gunmen, or, in the case of one Chinese laborer, tossed into a ravine by a racist posse. He...",https://time.com/7334446/train-dreams-novel-adaptation-denis-johnson/,2025-11-21
The Marketplace of Ideas Isn't Working | TIME,"On a sweltering August afternoon in 1918, on the fourth floor of a hat factory on east 93rd Street in Manhattan, a young Russian immigrant named Hyman Rosansky tossed anti-war flyers out the window to the street below. The flyers urged workers to stage a general strike opposing American involvement in World War I and encouraged young men to boycott the draft. A pedestrian on the street handed one of the flyers to a local cop on the beat. A few hours later, Rosansky and several colleagues were arrested and charged under the Sedition Act of 1918 for impeding American war production and inciting resistance to the draft. Their case, Abrams vs. the United States, went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court where the defendants argued that their speech was protected by the First Amendment. But in 1919, the Court did not yet see the First Amendment as protecting freedom of expression such as dissent or protest.

The Best Colleges for Future Leaders 2026 | TIME,"America has long viewed higher education as critical to the growth of the U.S. economy. Past administrations have understood that federal grants to universities and colleges drove cutting-edge research in cancer therapies, quantum computing, and precision agriculture. As new career paths emerge, and more leaders are coming from unconventional backgrounds, the great majority of heads sitting across industries have come from well-regarded universities across the U.S. To understand the formative experiences and paths of American leaders, TIME and Statista analyzed a diverse group of 4,800 of the most influential figures shaping U.S. society today—from policymakers and corporate executives to leading scientists, educators, and cultural innovators.

The Science Behind Chris Hemsworth’s Alzheimer’s Documentary | TIME,"When actor Chris Hemsworth, who played Thor in the Marvel series, agreed to join a documentary exploring longevity several years ago, he figured he would learn about how to live better so that he could live longer. But he never anticipated he would find out something that could dramatically affect what those future years could look like. In the documentary series Limitless, released in 2022 by National Geographic, Hemsworth took a battery of tests to learn what he could do to extend his healthy years. A genetic test revealed, however, that he has two copies of the risk gene for Alzheimer’s. While the genes aren’t a guarantee he will develop the neurodegenerative disease, carriers have an eight to 10-fold higher risk. The diagnosis wasn’t a total surprise; Hemsworth’s grandfather had the condition, and his father Craig is living with it as well. While Hemsworth hasn’t developed any symptoms yet, his father is showing the first signs of memory loss. In a new National Geographic...",https://time.com/7335031/chris-hemsworth-alzheimers-documentary/,2025-11-19
The Billionaire Activist Who Wants to Be California's Governor | TIME,"Tom Steyer, a billionaire philanthropist and climate activist who previously made an unsuccessful run for president in 2020, has entered the already crowded race to replace Gavin Newsom as California's Governor. Eight other Democrats and two Republicans have thrown their hats in as well, and others are expected to announce bids soon. But the race still has no clear front-runner, with Newsom barred from running again by term limits and former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla both announcing they will not be running. Steyer launched his campaign on Tuesday with a pitch centered on affordability. “Californians deserve a life they can afford, but the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living,” the 68-year-old Democrat said in his announcement video, adding that he would make corporations “pay their fair share” and “launch the largest drive to build homes that you can afford in the history of California.” “Sacramento politicians are...",https://time.com/7335185/tom-steyer-california-governor-2026-billionaire-newsom/,2025-11-19
Hunt for Olympian Turned Alleged Drug Kingpin Escalates | TIME,"Ryan Wedding once raced with the world’s best snowboarders. In 2002, at the age of 21, he traveled to Salt Lake City as part of Canada’s Olympic team to compete in the men’s parallel giant slalom, ultimately finishing 24th out of 32 competitors. But in the two decades since, his life has taken a dramatic turn from those Olympic heights: Wedding, the alleged head of a billion-dollar drug ring, is on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list and the subject of an escalating manhunt. The former Olympian is allegedly the “largest distributor of cocaine” in Canada and operates “one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations” in the world, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a Wednesday press briefing, where she announced the unsealing of a new indictment against Wedding. He now faces additional charges on accusations that he ordered the murder of a federal witness who was prepared to testify against him.

Why South Africans Are Protesting the G-20 | TIME,"Just hours after telling journalists that “no country can be allowed to bully another” in reference to the U.S. boycott of the G-20 summit in Johannesburg this weekend, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the U.S. may attend after all, following extended negotiations between the two governments. The White House press secretary then shot down the claim, saying the U.S. would only send its acting ambassador to the closing ceremony, and accused Ramaphosa of “running his mouth.” Ramaphosa seems determined to accommodate the Trump Administration after months of antagonism and slander from the White House over a so-called “white genocide” against the white Afrikaner minority population. In May, the Oval Office showdown between Trump and Ramaphosa’s delegation—who attempted to correct the U.S. President’s claims that white Afrikaners are being persecuted—was difficult viewing for many South Africans.

From the Archives: Novelist Ernest Hemingway Dies of Gun Wounds - Los Angeles Times,"Sun Valley, Ida. — Ernest Hemingway, 61, the bearded American novelist who gained fame writing of death and violence, accidentally killed himself Sunday while cleaning a shotgun, his wife said. Mrs. Hemingway, the “Miss Mary” who accompanied him on his world travels, was asleep upstairs. She was awakened by the shot, found the body and summoned a doctor to their home at Ketchum, near here. Then she called Chuck Atkinson, a family friend, and asked him to put out a statement that the creator of “Farewell to Arms,” “The Old Man and the Sea” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls” was dead. “Mr. Hemingway,” the statement said, “accidentally killed himself while cleaning a gun this morning at 7:30 a.m.” Atkinson said it was the statement Mrs. Hemingway wanted, that she feels the death was accidental. He said no note was found. The county coroner, the sheriff and the prosecuting attorney talked for more than an hour and then decided not to call an inquest. “I can only say at this stage that the...",https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-ernest-hemingway-19610703-story.html,1961-07-03
From the Archives: Face of Great Actress Subtle Even in Death - Los Angeles Times,"Reporting From Paris — Sarah Bernhardt -- a famous French actress -- died March 26, 1923, in Paris. She was 78. She has a star on the Hollywood Star Walk. In 2005, the Los Angeles Times wrote: “[She] performed on stages all over the world, including four ‘farewell’ tours of America, made eight films and endorsed face cream, cars and Bronx real estate. Incomparably famous for the 60 years she was on stage and screen, she saw life as one long photo op and enthusiastically pioneered the cult of celebrity.” This article, from March 28, 1923, made The Times’ front page after her death. There is but one sentence today on the lips of Paris -- “Bernhardt is dead.” It has been uttered alike by concierges and Cabinet ministers, midinettes and princesses. One hears it spoken softly in cafes and whispered in churches. All who knew the actress personally are relating to groups of friends incidents in the life of the great woman.

A $2B NHL team seized control of youth hockey. Parents are fed up.,"Lisa Bry expected a standard meet-and-greet when she visited the manager of the local ice rink. Instead, she says that a front-office executive for a $2 billion National Hockey League team threatened her. Bry had just been elected president of Frisco Ice Hockey Association, a nonprofit hockey club for middle and high school students in Frisco, Texas. One of its board’s first actions under her leadership was to cancel the contracts of two coaches who had received dismal reviews from parent feedback surveys. But at the April 2023 meeting, Bry said Dallas Stars executive Keith Andresen told her that the Stars, which ran the rink where the club practices, wanted those coaches to stay. His next words are seared in her memory: “Let me remind you where you get your ice from.” Andresen later said he did not use those words. To Bry, though, the implication was clear: Unless the club gave the coaches their jobs back, the Stars could stop letting its six teams practice in their rinks.

Top Trump officials' stock sales clustered before tariff news,"Several top Trump administration officials sold off stock market holdings in the days leading up to the president’s announcements of sweeping tariffs that sparked fears of a global trade war and rattled financial markets. Sales by top officials, including Cabinet members, their deputies and senior White House officials were clustered in two 10-day periods leading up to President Donald Trump's major tariff announcements Feb. 13 and April 2, according to a USA TODAY analysis of 20 officials’ publicly available transaction forms. Of the stock and stock fund sales administration officials reported between Jan. 20 and April 30, 90% fell within 10 days of the tariff announcements. The Feb. 13 announcement had little immediate impact on the markets, but stock prices plummeted after April 2. The markets have recovered since April 9 when Trump paused the tariffs, and the S&P 500 index was up about 7.5% for the year as of July 21. “It is concerning and begs the question of whether these public...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/22/trump-admin-stock-sales-clustered-tariff-news/84392169007/,2025-11-25

FAA says some air traffic controllers will get big bonuses,"Air traffic controllers who had perfect attendance during the government shutdown that caused weeks of strain on the system and forced flight cancellations will receive a $10,000 bonus, the Federal Aviation Administration announced. The bonuses will go to 776 air traffic controllers and technicians, just a fraction of those who worked without pay, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford announced on Nov. 20. The payments will go out no later than Dec. 9, they said. ""Santa’s coming to town a little early,"" Duffy said in a social media post.

America's 250th birthday is about to be everywhere. Read this first.,"From the start, America has been a journey, not a destination. The journey has been a literal one, from Paul Revere's ride to the Underground Railroad to the Oregon Trail. A country founded as 13 colonies clustered along the Atlantic Coast has become a cross-continent behemoth of 50 states and 342 million people. The journey has been metaphorical, too. A nation where the right to vote had been generally limited to property-owning White men has now watched a Black man elected as president, a woman sworn in as speaker of the House, and eight justices who were not White men confirmed for the Supreme Court. Through it all, the debates over what defines the United States have been fierce and sometimes violent. What rights? Whose rights? Who decides? The founders themselves were at times divided as they drafted the Declaration of Independence in 1776, a bold step in the middle of the Revolutionary War that helped forge a new nation.

Fastest wind speed record challenged by new hurricane data,"With a gust in Hurricane Melissa setting a record for peak gust measured by a specialized instrument dropped into the eye of a hurricane – 252 mph – you might be wondering what the fastest wind speeds ever recorded are. The question, like many, can take you down a rabbit hole: A lot of nuance is based on who's measuring and what's being measured. But we turned to a few sources of authority for a look at some of the top speeds in nature − and in cars. The World Meteorological Organization keeps an official record of weather and climate extremes. The strongest recorded surface wind is 253 mph, according to the Rapporteur of Weather and Climate Extremes for the WMO project, Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University. That wind was measured at Barrow Island, Australia, by an automated weather station during Tropical Cyclone Olivia on April 10, 1996.

Macy's Thanksgiving parade balloons introduce classic characters,"Kicking off Thanksgiving Day for the 99th time, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will wind its way through the streets of Manhattan with its blend of floats, bands, Santa Claus and the larger-than-life character balloons.

Balloons vary in size but can exceed the length of a couple of school buses. The 2025 parade will feature five new characters among an array of 34 balloons. Classic video game icons PAC-MAN and Mario join Buzz Lightyear from Pixar's ""Toy Story"" franchise, Derpy Tiger from Netflix's ""KPop Demon Hunters,"" and the onion carriage with eight characters from DreamWorks' ""Shrek"" movies.

The reason for her concern was the confirmation of her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the U.S. Health and Human Services secretary in February. In an essay in the New Yorker on Nov. 12, in which she revealed that she had less than a year to live, Schlossberg minced no words about the damage she believes Kennedy’s actions have and will inflict on cancer patients and on medical research.

Could offshore drilling ruin America's coastlines?,"Nature lovers, scientists and politicians worry the beloved California coastline, from the Redwoods to Santa Monica, will be endangered by the Trump administration's latest call for expanded offshore drilling. While oil and gas industry leaders lauded the plan, environmentalists and a group of California legislators quickly blasted it, fearing the potential havoc an oil spill or other accident could wreak on tourism and natural resources along the coast. They say the millions of tourists and residents who visit the scenic locations contribute tens of billions to the state's coastal economy. The worries extend far beyond California, to Florida’s beachfront economy and to remote and protected wilderness areas in Alaska.

"What is echinacea good for? Experts discuss cold, flu supplement","We’re nearing the height of cold and flu season, and if you’re starting to feel a little under the weather, you’ve probably heard of a supplement that might help ease your symptoms: echinacea. Echinacea, better known as coneflowers, is a perennial plant native to North America. The medicinal uses of the echinacea date back centuries. Many indigenous groups harnessed the plant as a painkiller, where it was used to treat everything from toothaches and sore throats to common colds and the flu. Today, there’s no shortage of supplements formulated with echinacea extract. But is there science to back up echinacea’s immune-boosting potential? Echinacea supplements come in a few different forms, from capsules to liquid extracts. The echinacea plant is packed with potent antioxidants, and contains a wide net of compounds that are thought to help reduce free radicals and combat inflammation in the body, says Megan Ramaika, a bariatric dietitian at Medstar Washington Hospital Center.

Last year, the funding was distributed to states by the end of October, and officials now say it may not arrive until the end of November. Meanwhile, local agencies have been scrambling to find assistance as cold weather hits parts of the country and electricity costs balloon, a growing concern as more home heating now relies on electricity. The delay prompted a Nov. 14 letter by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Jack Reed (D-RI) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) asking the Department of Human Services to hurry up. The letter, signed by 31 senators across the aisle, said: “We request that you quickly release LIHEAP funds at the highest level possible, so that low-income households do not have to choose between paying for heat and affording other necessities like food or medicine.” ""With temperatures...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/energy/2025/11/24/heat-assistance-lags-electric-bills-balloon-temperatures-drop/87334792007/,2025-11-25

What happened in Slender Man case? A look back at 2014 stabbing.,"A Wisconsin woman's brief disappearance from a group home has reignited public interest in the so-called Slender Man stabbing case of which she was a perpetrator. Morgan Geyser was taken into custody in Illinois on Nov. 23 after escaping a group home a day prior. She went missing after cutting off her Department of Corrections monitoring bracelet, according to police in Madison, Wisconsin. Geyser, who is now 23, was charged with attempted homicide at age 12 after stabbing her friend, Payton Leutner, and leaving her for dead in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Geyser and co-defendant Anissa Weier claimed they perpetrated the stabbing to appease the fictional Slender Man character. They were both found not guilty by reason of mental defect in 2017 and sentenced to mental confinement. Geyser is one of two perpetrators in the 2014 attempted murder stabbing of Leutner.

Murdered Black voting-rights activists and unpunished killers,"The ""Injustices"" series, published by the USA TODAY Network in collaboration with the Equal Justice Initiative, seeks to confront the realities of racial injustice, reckon with their enduring effects, and preserve these narratives as part of America’s collective history. Lamar “Ditney” Smith knew the dangers of helping Black citizens vote in Mississippi in 1955. He had received death threats, and knew about many Black people who had been lynched in his county. In May, white men had killed another Black activist, the Rev. George W. Lee, for registering voters in Mississippi. State Democratic party chairman Thomas Tubb declared, “We don’t intend to have Negroes voting” in the August primary, and said those who did vote might get “a whipping.” But Smith, a 63-year-old World War I veteran and farmer, kept at it.

Canadian businesses are feeling impact of Trump's tariff war,"MONTREAL – Alain Ejeil is a restaurant owner, not someone looking to stir up trouble. He’d much rather serve up dishes like poulet à la Basquaise, braised chicken with puréed potatoes in olive oil, or tartare de boeuf, beef with an emulsion of lime, capers and chives. But if you buy either of those specialties at his restaurant, Bidon Taverne Culinaire, just outside of Montreal, the chicken or the beef won’t come from the United States. Nor can you pair those dishes with a California chardonnay or an Oregon pinot noir. Ejeil stopped buying American food items and pulled U.S.-made wines and spirits from his shelves back in February after President Donald Trump started to taunt Canada with the threat of tariffs and American statehood. It wasn’t an easy decision, he said, but as a Canadian, it was the right thing to do. “I love America,” he said. But he also feels a duty to his country and his kitchen.

Trump's immigration raids are hitting farms hard. So what's next?,"For Candice Lyall, cherry harvest is always a race against the clock. Eastern Washington is famous for its cherries, and in the fourth-generation farmer’s lush orchards, not far from Columbia River, there’s just a short window when they are the perfect ripeness. Wait too long and they are too soft for sale. And they must be picked by hand. Lots of them. Finding those hands locally can be a challenge. Like other growers, some of her workers are foreign-born, whose presence is reflected in the Hispanic restaurants in the nearby 3,300-resident town of Mattawa. But this summer the harvest coincided with President Donald Trump’s mass deportation sweeps. Rumors swirled of roadway checkpoints. More than 100 workers who started Lyall’s harvest dwindled to 30 by the second week, leading her farm to struggle to get cherries picked in time. Some were picked too late, she said, but the financial hit to her farm was likely to be far less than what some other growers experienced. “There's a lot of...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/27/trump-immigration-deportation-farmers/85308530007/,2025-11-25
College football Re-Rank: BYU rises in NCAA 1-136 after Week 13,"Ohio State, Indiana, Texas A&M and Georgia remain atop the USA TODAY Sports NCAA Re-Rank 1-136 heading into a crucial Thanksgiving weekend that will help determine the makeup of the College Football Playoff. The first change in the new 1-136 doesn’t come until Brigham Young rises two spots to No. 11, replacing Utah. The Utes dropped three spots after barely winning a shootout against Kansas State. The re-rank shakes things up in the ACC after another brutally disappointing weekend defined by Georgia Tech’s faceplant against Pittsburgh. The 42-28 loss drops the Yellow Jackets to No. 25, while the Panthers climb four spots to No. 24. The highest-ranked ACC team remains No. 13 Miami, followed by No. 22 SMU. The Mustangs rise seven spots after beating Louisville 38-6. The logjam continues among the top teams in the American and Sun Belt frontrunner James Madison.

"Thanksgiving weather forecast says rain, snow, travel delays possible","Heavy rain and snowstorms expected across wide swaths of the United States this week could muck up Thanksgiving travel for millions of Americans taking to the roads and skies. Much of the country, from Seattle to Dallas, could be hit with heavy rain, wind and thunderstorms throughout the week, according to AccuWeather meteorologists, and some areas in the northern United States may see several inches of snowfall. The storm is expected to begin dropping rain and mountain snow in New Mexico and Colorado on Sunday, before moving east over the Plains region early in the week and toward the Midwest and East Coast closer to Thanksgiving. “The best chance of severe weather will be in the South Central and Southeastern states,” AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok predicted.

NBA Week 5 power rankings: LeBron James returns for rising LA Lakers,"NBA action is intensifying, as the league is turning quickly to December. That also means the NBA Cup picture is clarifying, with group stage play concluding Friday, Nov. 28. The league, however, is contending with several injuries to star players, forcing players like Bucks forward-center Giannis Antetokounmpo, Magic forward Paolo Banchero, Spurs forward-center Victor Wembanyama and plenty others to miss time. To that point, it's the teams managing those absences well who are the ones remaining competitive. And no team has weathered the loss of an All-Star better than the Oklahoma City Thunder, the reigning NBA champions.

Chauncey Billups arraignment: NBA coach pleads not guilty,"NEW YORK — Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups pleaded not guilty on Monday during his appearance at a federal courthouse in Brooklyn on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy as authorities accuse the Naismith Hall of Famer of being the ""face card"" in a scheme that helped lure players to poker games held in Las Vegas, where sophisticated machines were used to dupe victims out of millions of dollars. Both charges carry a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison if convicted. Billups' attorney Marc Mukasey entered the plea on behalf of his client before U.S. District Judge Ramon Reye during the brief session. Billups, dressed in a gray suit and light blue dress shirt, and flanked by his attorneys, arrived at the Theodore Roosevelt United States Courthouse in Brooklyn, home to the Eastern District of New York, nearly an hour before his arraignment, which was also a status conference hearing for the other 30 defendants in the case, dubbed...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2025/11/24/chauncey-billups-gambling-scheme-arraignment-pleads/87445495007/,2025-11-25
"Caroline Kennedy, Tatiana Schlossberg and acute myeloid leukemia","Journalist and author Tatiana Schlossberg, President John F.

Schlossberg, 34, wrote in a heart-wrenching essay for the New Yorker published Nov. 22 she learned she had acute myeloid leukemia after giving birth to her second child in May 2024.

"Who's in the Epstein emails? Summers, Bannon among names mentioned.","Dozens of people who communicated with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein over the years are now being scrutinized for their relationship based on emails that lawmakers released to the public. The late financier's correspondents are mostly men, and the recognizable names include an economist, a scientist, an investor and a journalist. They sought advice about pursuing women, discussed current events and otherwise bantered in these pen pal friendships. These email exchanges took place years after Epstein became a registered sex offender in 2008. Between a federal indictment, a police investigation, civil lawsuits, and public allegations, Epstein is accused of recruiting and trafficking more than 1,000 girls as young as 14 to participate in sex with him, his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and other men. Women have said they were abused all over the world ‒ in California, Florida, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, the United Kingdom and the Virgin Islands — by Epstein, his associate Ghislaine...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/22/who-is-in-epstein-emails/87355649007/,2025-11-25

Education Department's role is bigger than critics realize | Opinion,"When U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon claimed in USA TODAY that the recent government shutdown showed “how little the Department of Education will be missed,” she overlooked the damage done to the nation’s students, especially those with disabilities, who learn and think differently. For students with disabilities, the impacts of the shutdown were real and immediate: These are not disposable bureaucratic tasks, as McMahon claimed. They are federal responsibilities that ensure students receive what the law promises. In March, the Education Department chief stated in a televised interview that she could not recall what the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) stands for. That moment matters. IDEA is the cornerstone federal law protecting more than 7 million students with disabilities, which is 15% of all K–12 students.

What is considered a 'professional degree'? The term explained.,"As President Donald Trump's administration redefines which degrees are considered ""professional,"" many graduate students are left with questions and concerns about how to finance their education. Who is considered a professional student? The list includes programs like pharmacy, dentistry, medicine, veterinary medicine and law, among others. The list may not be all-inclusive, but advocates and professional organizations sounded the alarm that it leaves off many important programs, including nursing. The Department of Education emphasized that it did not update the federal definition of “professional degree” to exclude nursing – the definition never included it, said Ellen Keast, a representative for the agency. The confusion and controversy stem from a 1965 federal law, which defines a ""professional degree"" as one that ""signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/21/what-considered-professional-degree-explained/87396245007/,2025-11-25

Shane Bowen fired: Giants part ways with DC after Week 12 loss,"The New York Giants have fired defensive coordinator Shane Bowen, according to Art Stapleton of NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network. The news comes one day after New York blew another double-digit lead in a Week 12 loss to the Detroit Lions on the road. Outside linebackers coach Charlie Bullen has been tabbed as the Giants' interim defensive coordinator, Stapleton has reported. Leading 27-17 with 11 minutes to play on Sunday, Nov. 23, the Giants let their lead slip by giving up a 49-yard rushing touchdown to Jahmyr Gibbs, then a game-tying, 59-yard field goal with 30 seconds left. Bowen's defense has been maligned this season for its inability to maintain leads down the stretch. Through 12 weeks, New York has won just two of the seven games in which the team has taken a double-digit lead.

"NIH cuts hurt healthcare, brain injury research | Opinion","If not for years of brain research, I would be living in unending, unremitting pain. My head would be twisted to one side, and I’d cope as best I could with a diet of old-timey muscle relaxants and painkillers. Some muscles would atrophy, while others would become abnormally large. But brain research permits me to live with my cervical dystonia, a relatively rare brain condition, with no pain. The research resulted in a treatment – Botox injections in muscles that my brain is ordering to contract – that has few serious side effects. I can concentrate. I kayak, bike, lift weights. I can do anything I want. A year ago, I freeclimbed up a sheer rock face. Brain conditions run the gamut from migraines to multiple sclerosis, from dementia to dyslexia.

Chip Kelly fired by Raiders hours after meltdown against Browns,"The Las Vegas Raiders acted swiftly in response to their latest offensive letdown.

""I would like to thank Chip for his service and wish him all the best in the future."" Senior offensive assistant Bob Bicknell was also fired by the team, according to multiple reports on Monday. Kelly, the former head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers, became the NFL's highest-paid offensive coordinator at $6 million per year, according to multiple reports, when he was hired by Carroll in February.

Library goers don't need government dictating what to read | Opinion,"In an attempt to broaden the scope of book-banning efforts, the state of Tennessee is trying to make public librarians act as censors. It’s a bad fit. Relying on an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January, officials there are arguing that public libraries must remove books that “promote gender ideology."" Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett has sent a letter to multiple public libraries throughout the state, ordering them to identify any materials in their children’s collections that may be inconsistent with “Tennessee age-appropriateness laws"" or Trump's executive order regarding ""gender ideology."" A book called “Fred Gets Dressed,” by award-winning author Peter Brown, drew particular notice from the secretary of state.

There were so many highly specialized companies on the massive show floor, experts in everything from the misting fans that cool guests off in queues to the soft pretzels sold at snack stands, and of course, the makers of the rides themselves. “When you look at an amusement park, it's actually a village,” Jakob Wahl, president and CEO of IAAPA, the global trade association for the attractions industry, told USA TODAY. The whole village showed up at IAAPA Expo with their latest and greatest offerings. Here are five of the top things I saw and one thing I didn’t.

Strength training,"Growing up, my mother showed me that weightlifting is for women every week as she lifted weights in our garage. As a toddler, I mimicked her strength training movements, which is why I now lift five days a week with the Speediance Gym Monster 2, an all-in-one workout system with a 220 lb. resistance level. Strength training has always been a part of my life, but it’s still not for many women. According to the 2020 National Health Interview Survey, only 26.9% of women in the U.S. strength train, despite the health benefits it can offer. We spoke to experts who recommend that women of all ages should begin resistance training today. According to ACSM-CEP Clinical Exercise Physiologist Karen Owoc muscle loss begins for people in their 30s. “For menopausal women, this age-related muscle loss is exacerbated due to the decline in estrogen levels, making it crucial for women between the ages of 45 and 55 to prioritize strength training to maintain muscle mass and strength,” Owoc says....",https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/24/strength-training/85945528007/,2025-11-25
"How to tell when pecan pie is done, according to pastry chefs","Thanksgiving menu prep is stressful. And then there's the issue of actually cooking and baking everything properly. When it comes to desserts, pecan pie is a classic Thanksgiving treat. But even when you have a great recipe, it can be difficult to know when it's the right time to pull it out of the oven, given that you can't use the top crust that most other pies have as a barometer. USA TODAY spoke to several pastry chefs and baking experts, many of whom host their own Thanksgiving dinners and offer dessert tables full of pies topped with ice cream, whipped cream and other goodies. While they all have different favorite Thanksgiving desserts, they agree on one thing: Dessert is a dish best prepared ahead of the big day. ""Plan on having the pie dough made, rolled out and shaped in the pan,"" advises Merrie Johnson, Executive Pastry Chef of Bai-Tee Bakery in Ocean City, Maryland. ""Make a back up as a spare dough, because you can never have too much pie ready for the holidays.

I'm conservative. How I'm handling Thanksgiving under Trump | Opinion,"For this Forum installment, we wanted to know how you navigate the potential political minefield of family gatherings. We asked you if there are folks of varying political persuasions at your Thanksgiving celebration. Or if you keep away from certain friends or family over the holidays, to avoid disagreements – and spilled cranberry sauce?

Or maybe there are people you've cut out of your life completely because their beliefs are too much for you to stomach. Your responses laid out a smorgasbord of experiences.

Did Mets or Rangers prevail in Marcus Semien-Brandon Nimmo trade?,"The New York Mets and Texas Rangers swapped a pair of veteran players on Sunday Nov. 23, as both teams begin their offseason reshuffling. In a one-for-one deal, the Mets picked up three-time All-Star second baseman Marcus Semien in exchange for left-handed hitting outfielder Brandon Nimmo. While this trade lacks the intrigue and has fewer long-term implications than last week's Orioles-Angels deal, it might provide an ever-so-slight indication of the direction both teams are headed during the offseason. Let's take a look at how the deal impacts the Mets and Rangers, and hand out some grades on how well they improved their overall rosters. The addition of Semien, who won his second career Gold Glove in 2025, should help stabilize the revolving door the Mets had last season at second base, where Jeff McNeil, Brett Baty and Luisangel Acuña all saw action. It also allows McNeil to move to the outfield on a regular basis, essentially filling the void created by Nimmo's departure.

A firsthand look at American Airlines' new Flagship Suites,"When you have a 16-hour flight, there's no beating a lie-flat seat. I’ve had the opportunity to fly business class a handful of times in my life, and my baseline reaction is always “this is great.” Whether you're nestled in a cozy older seat or enjoying a sleek, modern suite, the opportunity to relax in a flat bed at 35,000 feet is simply unbeatable. So, when I had the chance to test out American Airlines’ new business class suite on a flight from Dallas to Brisbane earlier this month, I knew it was going to be a good experience. American introduced its new Flagship Business suite on recently-delivered Boeing 787 aircraft, starting with flights between Chicago and London in June. The planes were later also assigned to flights from Philadelphia to London and Zurich, and seasonal service from Dallas to Brisbane. The airline’s new premium-heavy 787 configuration includes 43 business class suites, 32 premium economy recliners, 18 extra legroom economy seats, and 143 seats in the main...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2025/11/21/american-airlines-flagship-suite-review/87319040007/,2025-11-25
Meta allegedly had 17-strikes policy for sex trafficking posts,"A former employee of Meta, the owner of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, testified as part of a major lawsuit that the tech company had a policy allowing 17 strikes before it suspended accounts engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex.” Vaishnavi Jayakumar, former head of safety and well-being for Instagram, also testified that in March 2020, Meta did not have a specific way for people to report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on Instagram, according to federal court documents filed Friday, Nov. 21, in the Northern District of California. ""It was very surprising to me,” Jayakumar said, adding that she tried to raise this issue “multiple times,” but was told it would require too much work to build. Jayakumar's concerns heightened when she learned of what she called the ""17x"" policy at Meta. “That means that you could incur 16 violations for prostitution and sexual solicitation, and upon the 17thviolation, your account would be suspended,"" she...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/11/22/meta-strike-policy-sex-trafficking-violations-testimony/87425612007/,2025-11-25
What is driving higher used car prices in 2025?,"The prices of new and used cars have been stubbornly high for a while. But this year, those high prices are standing out. New vehicles even hit a milestone in September, with average transaction prices passing the $50,000 mark for the first time, according to Kelley Blue Book. But the used vehicle market is also a challenge for the budget conscious. Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, said there’s something unusual about the price of 3-year-old used cars, which saw average transaction prices above $30,000 in the third quarter of this year, at $31,067, up 5% from the same period last year. It’s the highest third-quarter average transaction price since 2022, when the average hit $31,259, according to data supplied by Edmunds. In fact, prices on 3-year-old used cars have been above that $30,000 mark all this year, hitting average transaction prices of $30,522 in the first quarter and $31,216 in the second. “To see the trend continue, now we’re seeing something abnormal,” Drury...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/cars/shopping/used-cars/2025/11/24/higher-used-car-prices-2025/87445439007/,2025-11-25
How to read eye prescription (because it's confusing),"If you’ve ever walked out of an eye exam clutching a fresh prescription, wondering what all those numbers and abbreviations mean, you’re not alone. Eye prescriptions often look like a jumble of pluses, minuses, decimals and cryptic labels; more like something from NASA than a slip of paper meant to help you see clearly. But the truth is far less mysterious once you understand what you’re looking at. Knowing the basics of your prescription can help you choose the right lenses, avoid ordering mistakes and shop with confidence whether online or at the optometrist’s office. From the difference between OD and OS to what sphere, cylinder and axis values mean, here’s how to decode your eye prescription so you know exactly what's needed for optimal vision. An eye prescription is a precise record of the corrective power your eyes need to bring what you see into focus. “They exist to help light focus properly in your eye,” says Dr. Laura Di Meglio, an instructor of ophthalmology at the Wilmer...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/24/how-to-read-eye-prescription/87278134007/,2025-11-25
World leaders gather after Trump sets deadline for Russia-Ukraine plan,"Ukrainian, American and European officials gathered in Geneva on Nov. 23 to discuss a draft plan presented by Washington to end the war in Ukraine after Kyiv and its allies voiced alarm over what they saw as major concessions to the aggressor Russia. President Donald Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had until Nov. 27 to approve the 28-point plan, which calls on Ukraine to cede territory, accept limits on its military and renounce ambitions to join NATO. For many Ukrainians, including soldiers fighting on the front lines, such terms would amount to capitulation after nearly four years of Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II. On Nov. 22, however, Trump said his proposal for ending the war is not his final offer. Zelenskyy posted a video on X from the meeting in Geneva on Nov. 23 saying that while he was grateful for all the support, it was important to ensure that the steps taken to end the war are effective.

Trump wants to fund health savings accounts,"President Donald Trump and Republicans have floated an alternative to the Affordable Care Act: Send money directly to consumers instead of health insurance companies. Proposals vary and details are few, but Republicans are championing these options as Congress has yet to vote on the fate of cheaper health insurance for millions of Americans. Democrats want to bolster the Affordable Care Act, often called ""Obamacare,"" by extending COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits that expire at the end of 2025. Without these enhanced tax credits, average costs for 22 million Americans who get subsidized ACA insurance will more than double on Jan. 1, 2026, according to KFF, a health policy nonprofit. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, promised a vote on the enhanced tax credits by mid-December but would not guarantee Republicans' support to extend the subsidies. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, hasn't committed to a vote and called the enhanced tax credits a ""boondoggle.""

Dharmendra death: Bollywood acting legend dead at 89,"MUMBAI — Dharmendra Deol, who became one of India's most prominent actors and a Bollywood action hero, died in Mumbai on Monday, Nov. 24, according to local media. He was 89. Dharmendra, who is survived by two wives and six children, had been ill for the past month and died at home, local media reported. There was no official statement from the actor's family, but several of his contemporaries, including actor Amitabh Bachchan, gathered at a crematorium in the Mumbai suburb of Juhu for his funeral. ""A massive mega star, the embodiment of a hero in mainstream cinema,"" producer and director Karan Johar, who cast Dharmendra in his 2023 film ""Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani"" (Rocky and Rani's Love Story), wrote in an Instagram post.

Mamdani and Trumo meet at White House. See how the leaders compare,"One's a New Yorker and sometimes Floridian who's into the American presidency, real estate and reality TV. The other's a New Yorker, too, who's fond of cricket, the Wu-Tang Clan and hoping to turn a housing crisis and economic despair into action in his new job at City Hall. President Donald Trump and New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani don't agree on a lot of things. Their politics contrast. They have very different if privileged upbringings. They come from opposite style corners. But they are both charismatic leaders with populist agendas who have defied doubters and tapped into political zeitgeists to ascend the halls of power. They met at the Oval Office on Nov. 21 Here's a look at how they stack up in obvious and not-so-obvious ways. When it comes to personal wealth, the differences between the two men could not be more stark — Forbes places Mamdani's net worth at about $200,000 and Trump's at a staggering $7.3 billion.

Pauline Hanson dons burqa as political prop in Australia Parliament,"SYDNEY, Australia − Australian far-right Sen. Pauline Hanson wore a burqa to Parliament as a political prop in her push to ban the Muslim garment in public, sparking accusations of racism from Muslim senators over the stunt. Hanson wore the burqa on Nov. 24, shortly after she was denied permission to introduce a bill that would outlaw burqas and other full-face coverings in public places in Australia. It was the second time Hanson had used the head garment, worn by some Muslim women, in parliament in an effort to ban the public wearing of burqas. The Senate erupted in anger as she walked into the chamber wearing the burqa, and proceedings were suspended when Hanson refused to remove it. ""This is a racist senator, displaying blatant racism,"" said Muslim Mehreen Faruqi, a Greens senator from the state of New South Wales.

"Delaware neighbors' dispute and the court fight over garden, animals","Neighbors of a suburban townhome community in Delaware had already been in a five-year, bitter legal feud over one resident's backyard oasis-turned-animal sanctuary when animal welfare officers descended on the property and seized nearly 100 animals in September. Mark Ptomey, the owner of the sanctuary nonprofit in New Castle, was charged with more than 200 animal welfare misdemeanors and violations after state agents pulled dozens of dogs, cats and rats from what they described as various states of sickness, squalor and malnutrition in his townhome and expanded backyard. In court filings, Ptomey flatly denied the state's claims about condition of the animals under his care. And the 39-year-old wrote that the charges are a result of a yearslong harassment campaign by his neighbors over a boundary dispute that centers on his expansive, fenced-in backyard that partially wraps around and dwarfs neighbors' yards in the tucked-away, treelined cul-de-sac known as Stonebridge Townhomes.

12 festive holiday dishes from around the world in photos,"While snow is drifting down on Parisian patisseries during the holiday season, in Sydney, the sun is shining, and shrimp are sizzling. Celebrations may look different around the world, and each culture has a story to tell through its food traditions. From latkes to KFC, borscht to Bûche de Noël, here’s how 12 beloved dishes reflect the world’s savory and sweet traditions this time of year. So much more decadent than its direct translation might suggest (""log of Christmas""), the beloved bûche de Noël dates back to pre-Christian pagan traditions. The Celts burned a large log for the winter solstice, while at Christmastime, medieval families lit up the log for good luck. As hearth sizes diminished and the custom faded in the 19th century, the more practical and delicious dessert version gained popularity in France and other French-speaking countries.

What is NAD+? Potential benefits and safety,"If your social media has been inundated with videos on NAD+ supplements, with influencers swearing by their ability to slow down the aging process and improve longevity, you might be wondering: Do the supplements actually live up to their potential benefits? Researchers have started to turn their attention toward this elusive molecule, but current data is still quite limited. Here’s what NAD+ can, and probably can’t, do for your health, according to experts. NAD+, otherwise known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is a co-enzyme that’s naturally occurring in the body. It is involved in a few bodily functions, but it primarily helps facilitate metabolic reactions within our cells to help create energy. You can think of it like this: “If your cell is a car, NAD would be the oil, not the gas,” says Dr. Angelo Landriscina, a board-certified dermatologist. NAD+ is also central to DNA repair, balancing your circadian rhythm and regulating your metabolism, says Dr. Kefah Al Ramahi, an...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/23/what-is-nad/87274062007/,2025-11-25
Traveling for Thanksgiving? Here's the forecast and what to know.,"Nearly 82 million Americans are expected to travel domestically over Thanksgiving, a record high according to AAA, but some will have a harder time than others as a storm sweeps across the country ahead of the holiday. “There's a little bit of everything for everybody, it seems like, spread out,” Paul Pastelok, senior meteorologist and lead long-range forecaster at Accuweather, told USA TODAY. “Different times where there's going to be problems across the country.” Here’s what travelers should know before heading out for Thanksgiving. Troubles are expected to begin Monday, Nov. 24, when Pastelok said a storm coming from Southern California could drench Central Texas with heavy rain and possible flooding. It's expected to shift into the Tennessee and Ohio Valley on Tuesday and possibly pool water and produce fog that could also impact flights. “That same system gets to the east on Wednesday, so the big cities like New York City, DC,” he said. “It may not be that heavy, but it may be...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2025/11/21/thanksgiving-travel-forecast-driving-tips/87355981007/,2025-11-25

NFL Week 12 winners and losers: Eagles crushed by conservative offense,"Week 12 in the NFL was no mere appetizer to the forthcoming Thanksgiving slate. Yes, the holiday schedule sure looks tantalizing, with the league trotting out a troika of highly consequential matchups. But a Sunday setup that initially looked light on thrills ended up holding its own when it came to producing entertainment, with three games going to overtime after double-digit comebacks. And with two-thirds of the regular season now wrapped up, it's hard to shake the emerging pecking order in certain parts of the playoff picture, even though nothing has been settled on that front. Here are the biggest winners and losers from NFL Week 12: Sunday looked like it could be calamitous for the Detroit Lions, who found themselves in a 10-point fourth-quarter hole at home against the shorthanded New York Giants.

Owl recovering after being rescued from concrete mixer in Utah,"A great-horned owl is on a path to recovery in Utah after being rescued from a concrete mixer. The owl, assumed to be a juvenile male born earlier this year, was found near a concrete mixer at a resort in St. George, Utah, Best Friends Animal Society said in a news release on Nov. 19. It is not known how the owl ended up in the concrete mixer. A Best Friends spokesperson told USA TODAY the person who found the owl called the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, who contacted Bart Richwalski, a Wild Friends supervisor at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, and it was eventually brought to the animal welfare organization's headquarters in Kanab, about 90 minutes away, on the morning of Nov. 1. About 25 percent of the owl's two-pound body was covered in dried concrete, Best Friends said, posing a major challenge for its staff. Richwalski said it was the first time they had seen a case like this in the sanctuary's 40-year history. “We reached out to other wildlife rehabilitators, and they had...",https://www.usatoday.com/story/pets-animals/2025/11/22/owl-concrete-mixer-rescue-recovery-utah/87375731007/,2025-11-25

A Poem by Traci Brimhall: ‘This Beautiful Confusion’ - The Atlantic,"Yes, I know my mind is a fickle little bee doting on a thousand thoughts, but I’m getting better at chasing my mind back to the moment so I can see the spiderwebs making hammocks the color of the moon. My son tries to photograph a rainbow outside the car window. It’s impossible, of course, this wonder, the trying to hold it. But I do what I can. I’ve stopped waiting to enjoy the cinnamon tea. I take deeper breaths and listen to the flutter of strings floating down from café speakers. I don’t want to be a pilgrim of memory anymore. I want to pop the champagne and salute this now, and this one with soft brie, dried apricots, and the sunset celebration another anniversary of light while I eat fists of grapes the same shade and sweetness of night. Congratulations, Time. Look at you and your gorgeous minutes full of everything. Three cheers for the temp agency that hired this particular day, these particular clouds, this set of honking geese migrating through it.

The Problem With Turkey Trots - The Atlantic,"The races fit the American tendency to pit excess against repentance—especially when it comes to food. Every Thanksgiving, while many people are preparing stuffing or frantically Googling how long turkeys take to defrost, others rise early, don commemorative T-shirts (and maybe turkey-shaped hats), and gather for a chilly morning run. This is the turkey trot, typically a 5- to 10-kilometer race, perhaps done for charity, which has become a delightfully contentious holiday tradition much like crack-of-dawn Black Friday lines and marshmallow topping on sweet potatoes. Participants look forward to the goofy costumes and collective endorphin rush; detractors consider the type of person who would voluntarily trade the extra holiday sleep for a cold jog that costs money to be a different species entirely. A host of memes, which feature pictures of festively clad runners in miserable weather, mock the race and those who run it with captions such as “Imagine meeting your soulmate and then...",https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/11/turkey-trot-tradition-american-diet-culture/676056/,2023-11-21
RFK Declares Vaccines Don’t Not Cause Autism - The Atlantic,"It hasn’t been ruled out. Let me make a small concession on behalf of the medical community: The CDC is technically correct when it asserts, as it did this week in a surprise update to its website, that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.” But the underlying logic of this change clearly goes beyond the wispy double negative. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has already said that he believes in the affirmative: Vaccines do cause autism. And because he is now secretary of Health and Human Services, he can order his bureaucracy to lean ever further toward that same belief. A causal link hasn’t not been found, the CDC is saying now—at least not completely, not quite yet. If this pretzel logic is confusing, that’s the point. Bewilderment and doubt are among the anti-vaccine movement’s most powerful weapons. It’s true that doctors cannot say with absolute certainty that some ingredient in some vaccine, or combination of vaccines, does not contribute in some...",https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/11/rfk-vaccines-dont-not-cause-autism/685026/,2025-11-21
Marjorie Taylor Greene Came So Close to Getting the Joke - The Atlantic,"What the Georgia representative learned in Washington When Jack Abramoff dominated Washington lobbying in the 1990s and early 2000s, he observed that there were two kinds of people in town: those who “get the joke” and those who don’t. Those who got the joke understood that all of the city’s talk of ideas and principles was flimflam to conceal self-enrichment at the public’s expense. Those who didn’t, didn’t. On the same day that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene resigned, The New York Times reported accusations that President Donald Trump’s handpicked director of the Kennedy Center, Richard Grenell, had used the fine-arts institution’s $268 million budget to dole out favors and enrich friends and allies. If the claims—which Grenell disputes—are correct, Abramoff would recognize a fine example of “getting the joke.” Greene didn’t get the joke. Elected to Congress in Georgia in 2020, she became one of the loudest voices in American life for crackpot conspiracy claims: Pizzagate,...",https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/marjorie-taylor-greene-resignation/685032/,2025-11-22

When Border Patrol Comes to Town - The Atlantic,"The new face of Trump’s immigration crackdown Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts The latest city official to contend with Border Patrol agents is Janet Cowell, mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina. When they landed in Raleigh this week, she didn’t know much about their plans; the best guidance she could offer residents was that if they felt unsafe, they should “call the police.” Since arriving in Los Angeles this June, agents from Customs and Border Protection have been making their way to other locations, first to Chicago, then New Orleans, and now North Carolina. They may head to New York City, according to reports, to greet incoming Mayor Zohran Mamdani. Along the way, they’ve collected civil-rights suits and irate federal judges, and the list of people they’ve arrested has been light on hardened criminals. They’ve also produced plenty of video footage. “Nobody tells us where to go, when to go, how to go in our fucking country,” Border Patrol...",https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/2025/11/when-border-patrol-comes-town/684989/,2025-11-20

Tilting the Playing Field - The Atlantic,"Trump and his allies seem to want to transform American politics into a system for producing Republican victory. Not long ago, ActBlue was a normal player in American politics. Its website served as a major fundraising platform for Democratic candidates and affiliated PACs, allowing them to reach known party donors and solicit grassroots support. But Donald Trump does not regard normal Democratic politics as acceptable. This spring, at his direction, the Department of Justice initiated an investigation of illegal “foreign contributions” through the ActBlue website. Although the investigation is ostensibly premised on ActBlue having illegally received donations from foreign donors, there’s no reason to think that the underlying motivation is anything but political. Indeed, the Republican fundraising platform, WinRed, is as vulnerable to foreign influence as the Democratic one, yet only the Democratic platform has been targeted. What is most troubling is that the attack on ActBlue is...",https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/tilting-playing-field/685035/,2025-11-23
What Sam Shepard Couldn’t Outrun - The Atlantic,"The actor, playwright, and self-made cowboy was also a poet of masculine angst. Listen to more stories on hark Sam Shepard wasn’t born a cowboy. The actor and writer made himself into one. The dusty blue jeans, cattle drives, and folksy drawl suited his taciturn profile, giving Reagan-era America someone rugged to admire. Yet the people who knew Shepard best poked fun at his Western persona, which began to emerge in the 1970s and endured for the rest of his life. The singer and poet Patti Smith, a former paramour, called him “a man playing cowboys,” and Shepard indeed acted in a number of Westerns. Late in his career, in Andrew Dominik’s movie The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Shepard portrayed the outlaw’s prickly brother. (He’d named his first child, Jesse, after the legend.) A line of narration from the movie seemed to sum up the complicated man behind the character: “wrought up, perplexed, despondent.” Check out more from this issue and find your next...",https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/01/sam-shepard-coyote-biography/684957/,2025-11-24
Why Marjorie Taylor Greene Needed Donald Trump - The Atlantic,"In the sweep of history, Marjorie Taylor Greene’s time in Congress will be a blip. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. A junior member of Congress from Georgia announced her resignation last night, ending a brief tenure in the House that produced, well, not a whole lot. Marjorie Taylor Greene is no legislative powerhouse, and in the grand sweep of American history, her five years as a U.S. representative will be a mere blip. She wrote no major laws and had little discernible impact on national policy. (For two of those years, she did not serve on a single House committee, having been booted from her assignments in a bipartisan vote because of comments she made prior to serving in Congress that, among other things, promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and the execution of Democratic lawmakers.) Yet if that had been all there was to say about Greene, then her abrupt decision to quit in the middle of her third term would not have made international headlines.

The disabled mother of three from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, had to visit food banks and skip meals so that her children could eat after the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program abruptly stopped paying out benefits on November 1. After running out of money to buy milk and watching her refrigerator go bare as Congress held a series of failed votes on a funding bill, Tracey told me, she now lives in fear that the federal aid she receives could be cut off again. She is filling her freezer with low-cost items and stocking up on nonperishables in case Congress closes the government again next year. “I’m going to make sure I have everything that I need to make sure my children are good,” she said. “I have been super stressed, but you have to do what you have to do as a parent, right?” In the week since the...",https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/government-shutdown-costs-damage-trump/685017/,2025-11-22

Why Study History? - The Atlantic,"Civic education can help us to see that not all problems have solutions, to live with tentative answers, to accept compromise, to embrace responsibilities as well as rights—to understand that democracy is a way of living, not a settled destination. EIGHTEEN NINETY-TWO WAS A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION year, and the exchanges between Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison, which were notably superficial and sometimes unsavory, avoided most of the toughest questions facing Americans at the time. Perhaps it was no accident, then, that at year’s end the illustrious Committee of Ten’s subcommittee on history (including Woodrow Wilson) proclaimed the need for all high school students, whether or not they were college-bound, to take four years of history courses about America and the outside world. Why? The study of history, they said, best prepared the student to exert “a salutary influence upon the affairs of his country,” because it best promoted “the invaluable mental power which we call...",https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1988/11/why-study-history/670027/,1988-11-01
Truman Capote: Shut a Final Door - The Atlantic,"WALTER, listen to me: if everyone dislikes you, works against you, don’t believe they do so arbitrarily: you create these situations for yourself.” Anna had said that, and, though his healthier side told him she intended nothing malicious (if Anna was not a friend, then who was?), he’d despised her for it, had gone around telling everybody how much he despised Anna, what a bitch she was: that woman! he said, don’t trust that Anna: this plainspoken act of hers — nothing but a cover-up for all her repressed hostility; terrible liar, too, can’t believe a word she says: dangerous, my God! And naturally all he said went back to Anna, so that when he called about a play-opening they’d planned attending together she told him: “Sorry, Walter, I can’t afford you any longer: I understand you very well, and I have a certain amount of sympathy: it’s very compulsive, your malice, and you aren’t too much to blame, but I don’t want ever to see you again because I’m not so well myself that I can...",https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1947/08/shut-a-final-door/643929/,1947-08-01

Pour One Out for Weed Seltzer - The Atlantic,"A new law is set to devastate the industry that brought THC sodas and cookies to American convenience stores. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Gas-station weed was never supposed to exist. And yet, convenience stores across the country—even in states where marijuana is illegal—sell a trove of fizzy drinks, vape pens, and confections all promising to get you high. My neighborhood liquor store has an entire cooler full of weed drinks, including a seltzer aptly named Bong Water, a can of which has 25 milligrams of THC. About five milligrams of that chemical, which is the main psychoactive component in marijuana, will make the occasional weed user feel a light buzz. If that’s not enough for you, you might be able to buy a vape pen with 5,000 milligrams at your corner store. These products are available because Congress messed up. In 2018, it passed a bill that was meant to support farmers by allowing them to grow hemp—essentially, weed bred with minimal THC—for industrial uses such...",https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/11/thc-marijuana-hemp-loophole/685016/,2025-11-21

California Is Tired of Letting People Die - The Atlantic,"Long-term involuntary treatment is back. Is it working? The blanket was filthy, and it was writhing—as if the person beneath it was trying to escape, or tear it apart. As I watched from a van just up the road, at the intersection of 17th and Vermont, in San Francisco, Sister Salvina, wearing the blue-and-white sari of Mother Teresa’s order, explained how best to approach the person under the blanket. We would bring a tremendous offering of food: two water bottles, two juices, two Egg McMuffins, one meat-and-cheese sandwich, four Uncrustables, one cup of oatmeal, one hot chocolate, one banana. She recommended I keep my tape recorder in my bag, and handed me the banana. The woman under the blanket was named Ashley. At the sound of Salvina’s voice, she pulled the blanket back so that it revealed her face but remained draped over her head like a hood. Her face was puffy and red, her eyes swollen into narrow slits—the aftermath of a pepper-spray attack, she said.

What the Deported Venezuelans Went Through in El Salvador - The Atlantic,"Forty men sent to El Salvador by the Trump administration have shared disturbing accounts of abuse by a regime that America paid to imprison them. Earlier this year, the United States deported 252 Venezuelans to El Salvador and paid its government to imprison them, despite clear evidence of human-rights abuses in the country’s prison system and forceful warnings that the men would suffer cruel and unusual treatment. Now two human-rights organizations, Human Rights Watch and the Central America–based Cristosal, have found that all of those men were physically abused. Citing prisoner testimony, their report claims that the men were held in filthy cells, psychologically tortured, and given fetid water to drink, and that guards sexually violated at least three of them.

The Old Guard Is Not Gone Yet - The Atlantic,"While the sitting president rage-posted, mourners memorialized Dick Cheney—and an earlier political era.

You never know who will show up to pay respects at gatherings of this sort, or what odd alliances and strange bedfellows will reveal themselves. Who gets invited and who doesn’t?

Why Is Robert F.

An Anatomy of the MAGA Mind - The Atlantic,"Under Trump, post-liberal intellectuals have abandoned tradition for radicalism and scholarship for vulgarity. “In the United States at this time,” the critic Lionel Trilling wrote in 1950, “liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition.” Conservatives and reactionaries, Trilling added, had no ideas, only impulses—“irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.” Whether the point was true in mid-century America—the reactionary writer Richard M. Weaver published Ideas Have Consequences, an attack on the modern West, two years before Trilling’s The Liberal Imagination—today it is obviously false. For the past decade or more, the intellectual energy in American politics has been on the right. In Furious Minds: The Making of the MAGA New Right, the political theorist Laura K.

The Perseid meteor shower was expected to peak that night, one of the best times of the year to see shooting stars. Stargazers could glimpse dozens an hour, golden streaks that appeared to fall from the constellation Perseus. At about 10 p.m., Ryan pushed the kayak into the inky-black water.

The Conservative Movement’s Intellectual Collapse - The Atlantic,"Trump is both a product and a cause of the decline in intellectual standards on the right. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. The Heritage Foundation, which has stood for decades as the intellectual crown jewel of the conservative movement, has been convulsed in an ugly public spat over the organization’s approach to anti-Semitism. Employees and visiting scholars are resigning from and revolting against the think tank over its defense of the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s interview with Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist and anti-Semite who has gained prominence in MAGA circles. The conflict has exposed the degree to which previously forbidden bigotries have penetrated the heart of the Trump-era Republican Party. It has also revealed a somewhat different, yet related pathology: the brain death of the conservative movement.

‘Wicked: For Good’ Bursts Its Own Bubble - The Atlantic,"The musical started on a high note but ends on a drastically lower one. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Last year’s Wicked film was a big, brassy delight. Yes, the director Jon M. Chu’s adaptation of the long-running Broadway musical—itself drawn from a revisionist riff on L. Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz—had its flaws (why was every outdoor scene so scorchingly overlit?). Yet the smash-hit film’s charms were hard to resist, the kind of sumptuous family fare that Hollywood should be serving up more often. I did detect one glaring issue. Presented in the opening title card was a footnote: the words Part One. Uh-oh. Postponing all the necessary wrap-up to a sequel seemed like leaving a pile of dirty dishes in the sink for tomorrow. Okay, maybe that second part, Wicked: For Good, isn’t quite that drastic a chore.

The Murky Plan That Ensures a Future War - The Atlantic,"Who will benefit from the White House’s 28-point proposal for Ukraine? Listen to more stories on the Noa app. The 28-point peace plan that the United States and Russia want to impose on Ukraine and Europe is misnamed. It is not a peace plan. It is a proposal that weakens Ukraine and divides America from Europe, preparing the way for a larger war in the future.

The plan was negotiated by Steve Witkoff, a real-estate developer with no historical, geographical, or cultural knowledge of Russia or Ukraine, and Kirill Dmitriev, who heads Russia’s sovereign-wealth fund and spends most of his time making business deals.

Sweet Potatoes Deserve So Much More Than Thanksgiving - The Atlantic,"All hail the sweet potato. Since the start of 2022, I’ve consumed more than my body weight in sweet potatoes. The average American eats closer to the equivalent of one (1) fry a day, but for the past decade, I’ve had at least half a pound of the roots at almost every dinner. I travel with sweet potatoes more reliably than I travel with my spouse. All I need in order to chow down is a microwave and something to cushion my hands against the heat. Tomorrow, Americans will finally put sweet potatoes in the spotlight—and still not appreciate all that they’re worth. Families across the country will smother the roots with sugar and butter beneath a crunchy marshmallow crust. This classic casserole may be the only serving of sweet potatoes some people have all year—which is a travesty in terms of both quantity and (sorry) preparation style.

The roughly six months that have made up November this year have—it’s fair to say—not been a high point for women, journalism, women in journalism, women with jobs, or anyone following the news.

Earlier this week, when a reporter at the White House asked Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, about the determination by U.S. intelligence that he was complicit in the killing of a Washington Post journalist—a finding that bin Salman has denied—Trump viciously scolded her for her “horrible, insubordinate” question. On the flip side, a reporter, doing herself zero favors in the take-me-seriously department, published an...",https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/11/trump-quiet-piggy-women-journalists/684982/,2025-11-20
Are Sports the Most Valuable Commodity in the World? - The Atlantic,"Pablo Torre on billionaire sportswashers, YouTube unboxing videos, and the rampant gambling that’s threatening the integrity of sports Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Are sports the most valuable commodity in the world? On this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel is joined by Pablo Torre for an examination of the role that sports and rampant sports betting are playing in our politics, culture, and economy. Pablo Torre is a longtime journalist and the host of the show Pablo Torre Finds Out, where he reports on everything from football fans on death row and what it’s like to be a transgender athlete in high school to analyzing the coach Bill Belichick’s shirtless ring-cam footage. Torre is a student of the internet as well, and a keen observer of our attention economy.

Who’s Ready to Think About Blocking Out the Sun? - The Atlantic,"The idea of artificially lowering the planet’s temperature is gaining supporters and hitting political opposition. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. For years, the idea of geoengineering—artificially lowering global temperatures through technological means—has been met with skepticism. Only a handful of dedicated and much-criticized scientists have argued for researching it at all, and when others weighed in, it was generally to trash the idea. This September, in a study published in the journal Frontiers in Science, more than 40 experts in climate change, polar geosciences, and ocean patterns warned that geoengineering was extremely unlikely to work and likely to have dangerous consequences. Spraying reflective aerosols into the atmosphere to deflect the sun’s heat, could, for instance, “cause stratospheric heating, which may alter atmospheric circulation patterns, leading to wintertime warming over northern Eurasia,” they wrote. Science fiction has more vividly imagined how...",https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2025/11/geoengineering-fight/685018/,2025-11-24
The President Is Losing Control of Himself - The Atlantic,"Donald Trump’s outbursts on social media this week were different than usual. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Presidents often lose control over their agenda, or the policy process, or pieces of legislation. Sometimes, they even lose control of their party. But Donald Trump seems to have lost control over the one thing every person, and especially those with immense power, should always maintain control over: himself. Yesterday the president called for the arrest and execution of elected American officials for the crime—as he sees it—of fidelity to the Constitution. It would be easy merely to note, yet again, that the president is a depraved man and a menace to the American system of government. As remarkable as it is to say it, however, the outbursts of this past week are different, and were likely triggered by Trump’s panic over the release of files about his former friend, the dead sex offender Jeffery Epstein. No one should treat this new phase in the president’s aggression...",https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/trump-truth-social-control/685019/,2025-11-21
The War Among MAGA Women - The Atlantic,"What does it mean to be female and conservative in 2025? Listen to more stories on the Noa app. One night at a party in an East Village speakeasy, a pair of 20-somethings—high on youth and rail liquor—made their way to the bar’s single-occupancy bathroom, and proceeded to go at it. I know this because as I waited outside, the exuberant young man inside began to film the encounter. The bright light of his phone had reversed the effects of the bathroom’s one-way mirror to reveal a pantsless youth with a deeply unfortunate broccoli haircut, and a young woman in a MAKE AMERICA HOT AGAIN cap. When I mentioned the encounter to the event’s organizer, Raquel Debono, she clapped her hands and squealed, “I told you people find love at my parties!” Debono’s path to party planning happened, in her telling, because she was bored. The MAGA gatherings she’d attended were stuffy. So last year, she started throwing parties under the auspices of a new movement—“Make America Hot Again”—to attract fun,...",https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/maga-women-great-divide/684827/,2025-11-20
The Intellectual and Moral Decline of the American Right - The Atlantic,"The conservative backlash against Nick Fuentes has yet to challenge the president who had him over for dinner. Last month, Tucker Carlson, the host of one of the country’s most popular podcasts, interviewed Nick Fuentes, a white-nationalist influencer, for more than two hours. The two men got along famously, and it was little wonder why. Carlson has become a fierce and obsessive critic of Israel; he has interviewed a Holocaust revisionist and said that “Christian Zionists” have “been seized by this brain virus.” Not everyone on the right was pleased. So in the aftermath of the Carlson-Fuentes conversation, Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, put out a video defending Carlson, a “close friend” of the institution, against the “venomous coalition attacking him.” Heritage’s proper role, according to Roberts, is to “focus on our political adversaries on the left, not attacking our friends on the right.” Roberts said he may disagree with, and even abhor, some of what...",https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/carlson-fuentes-heritage-foundation-maga/685014/,2025-11-22
Why Donald Trump Seems Taken With Zohran Mamdani - The Atlantic,"The president likes winners. And the mayor-elect proved he can charm a foe. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Today’s White House meeting between New York’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, and President Donald Trump suggests that maybe, just maybe, the U.S. government won’t go to war with its largest city. The event was much anticipated as blood sport, a showdown between a young communist and an old despot, to use their favored insults for each other. Instead, the two men put on such a show of good manners that at times I had to laugh out loud at the stagecraft. After a closed-door meeting, Trump and Mamdani summoned the press, and there was Uncle Donnie seated behind his desk in the Oval Office, beaming as his favorite nephew, Zohran, stood by his right shoulder looking dutiful. “We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump said, peering at Mamdani. “I feel very confident that he can do a very good job.” He does?

Our Almost-Apocalyptic Climate Future - The Atlantic,"By shooting for 3 degrees Celsius of warming, the world could slide toward a more cataclysmic 4 degrees. This year’s Conference of the Parties, the annual United Nations meeting meant to avert catastrophic climate change, was subject to a ham-fisted metaphor. On Thursday, the Brazilian venue hosting the conference burst into flames from what was likely an electrical fire. In its 30 years, COP has frequently been a ritual in frustration and futility, ending with a set of pledges and promises that have rarely gone as far as scientists say they need to, followed by weeks of postmortem finger-pointing and self-flagellation. And yesterday, once again delegates landed on a heavily compromised text that does little to materially steer the planet off fossil fuels. Many of the fingers pointed toward an empty chair and the absence of the largest oil-and-gas producer on planet Earth (the United States). Meanwhile, delegates from drowning, subsistence-farming volcanic archipelagos in the South...",https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2025/11/cop-climate-3c-warming/685036/,2025-11-23

Trump Under Pressure - The Atlantic,"Panelists joined to discuss events of the past month—and what they could mean for the president’s influence over Republicans. Earlier this week Donald Trump told a journalist “Quiet, piggy,” and later lashed out at another reporter in the Oval Office. On Washington Week With The Atlantic, panelists joined to discuss what could be behind the president’s comments, and more. November has been “a really tough month for Trump,” Toluse Olorunnipa, a staff writer at The Atlantic, said last night. A year ago, Trump was “at the peak of his political power,” and his first 10 months in office “were pretty much signs that there was very little that” could be done to stop him. But then, Olorunnipa noted, “we had the elections in the first part of this month.” Following major victories for Democrats in New York, New Jersey, and Virginia, Trump is beginning to realize “that he’s going to be a lame duck very soon,” Olorunnipa argued—and “people within his own party are starting to look past him.”...",https://www.theatlantic.com/national/2025/11/trump-pressure-washington-week/685031/,2025-11-22
The Corruption Scandal That Could Lose Ukraine the War - The Atlantic,"Corruption probes have dogged Ukraine’s leadership during the war. The latest one could be its undoing. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. In January 2021, about a year before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky celebrated his 43rd birthday at the home of his old friend and business partner Tymur Mindich. About two dozen guests showed up at Mindich’s place, inside a luxury tower known around Kyiv as the Monster, where Zelensky also owned an apartment. The party, held in violation of pandemic lockdown orders, generated embarrassing headlines. The president was forced to answer questions about why the rules imposed on ordinary citizens did not seem to apply to him and his friends. Last week, similar questions arose after Mindich and his apartment appeared at the center of one of the biggest corruption scandals in Ukraine’s history. Investigators have accused him of using the apartment as the headquarters (or, as they put it, the “back office”) of a...",https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2025/11/zelensky-ukraine-war-russia-corruption/684962/,2025-11-21

He argues that the incident is yet another example of Trump’s favor being won through personal gifts and another sign of how his administration has forced the United States to abandon its traditional leadership role in the global order, reshaping American foreign policy into something closer to that of an extractive predator state.

Read our Privacy notice Excessive usage of TikTok and Instagram Reels is damaging cognitive performance, the American Psychological Association has said in a recent study. Data from 98,299 participants across 71 studies found that the more short-form content a person watches, the poorer cognitive performances they had in terms of attention and inhibitory control - meaning the more complex they found it to focus. Researchers found that “repeated exposure to highly stimulating, fast-paced content may contribute to habituation, in which users become desensitized to slower, more effortful cognitive tasks such as reading, problem solving, or deep learning.” In short, researchers said it can contribute to brain rot. It concluded that short-form video use was “associated with poorer cognition...",https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/tiktok-instagram-videos-brain-rot-b2871391.html,2025-11-24
The red hair gene may hold the key to healing wounds | The Independent,"The discovery could benefit millions I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

These long-lasting wounds, often caused by diabetes, poor circulation or pressure, can be painful, prone to infection and can seriously affect quality of life. In severe cases, they can lead to amputation. Current treatments help manage symptoms, but they don’t always address the underlying problem. That means dressings, antibiotics and repeated clinic visits, often for months or years. For many people, that cycle never truly ends. But the latest research published by my colleagues and myself offers a new perspective on why some wounds just won’t heal – and points to a potential new way of treating them.

Sweet potato or pumpkin? The Thanksgiving pie debate | The Independent,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

For most people, the answer likely depends on where they’re from. The two Thanksgiving favorites have more in common than not.

Those similarities make them all the easier to compare. “Pumpkin,” said Lori Robinson, a customer at Sugar Magnolia Takery in Flowood, Mississippi. “My mom cooks it every Thanksgiving, Christmas, every time. It's way better than sweet potato.” Unlike some bakeries in the area, Sugar Magonlia Takery makes both pumpkin and sweet potato pies.

Read our Privacy notice Reports indicate that Wednesday’s Budget may include a significant tax overhaul targeting salary sacrifice schemes, prompting fears that some people’s retirement savings could be jeopardised. Here we take a look at how salary sacrifice schemes for pensions work and what could happen in Rachel Reeves’ Budget.

Often integrated into pension plans, this offers a tax-efficient route for workers to enhance their retirement savings. When contributing this way, the employer deposits the entire sum – including their own contribution – directly into the employee’s pension fund. There have been reports of a potential cap for people sacrificing their salary while still receiving the tax benefit at...",https://www.independent.co.uk/money/budget-rachel-reeves-salary-sacrifice-pension-b2871337.html,2025-11-24
Scientists ‘astonished’ as moss survives nine months in space | The Independent,"‘Most living organisms cannot survive even briefly in the vacuum of space,’ says researcher I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

A series of lab tests at Hokkaido University in Japan were undertaken to see how a type of moss called spreading earthmoss fared under stresses like UV radiation, extreme high and low temperatures, and vacuum conditions.

Read our Privacy notice Donald Trump is yet to carry out a threat he made four weeks ago to slap Canada with an additional 10 percent tariff over a “fraudulent” ad featuring former President Ronald Reagan. This year Trump has made a habit of threatening tariffs on trading partners, often resulting in a drop in the markets, only for him to walk it back, which in turn has earned him the nickname TACO — “Trump Always Chickens Out.” Trump was so furious over the Canadian ad last month — which featured spliced clips from Reagan’s 1987 address where the late president said tariffs caused trade wars and economic disaster — that he suspended trade talks with Canada.

There is a reason that cooks have long reached for their cast-iron skillets when making cornbread. The dark, heavy metal gives the crust a wonderful color and a wonderful crispness on the outside.

Research from Royal London shows that on average women have less than half the pension savings of men - £39,000 compared to £92,000. Although auto-enrolment in workplace pensions has helped a huge swathe of people put money towards their retirement, it’s still not an equal playing field. Part of that relates to older workers who were not in a workplace pension earlier in their lives, says Rowan Harding, an expert in women’s ethical finance, while other factors like the gender pay gap have widened the problem. “Someone who is younger is more likely to have been paying into a pension...",https://www.independent.co.uk/money/pensions-gap-savings-women-salaries-budget-b2797215.html,2025-11-24

Read our Privacy notice While Thanksgiving menus are a highlight, the celebratory meal often results in substantial food waste. Experts suggest that a little extra planning could significantly reduce this problem. This year alone, an estimated 320 million pounds (145 million kilograms) of food is projected to be discarded, according to ReFED, a non-profit tracking food waste. The organisation attributes this largely to over-preparation and uneaten leftovers. “That is essentially like five meals each for all of the food insecure people in the U.S.,” said Yvette Cabrera, food waste director at Natural Resources Defense Council. It's also a problem because most of that waste ends up in landfills, where it releases the potent planet-warming gas methane, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Want a Budget millennials won’t hate? Start by taxing life’s biggest nuisances | The Independent,"From boy racers to ultra-processed foods and doomscrolling, Britain’s worst habits cost us dearly, says Sophie Wilkinson – why doesn’t the chancellor put levies on them before taxing us again? I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice I look forward to the Budget like I look forward to rammed Tube carriages, A&E waits and Eighties synth hold music. I detest, yet I must persevere. With the cost of living crisis now biting so hard that last week I saw a curry – one singular chicken madras – that cost £26 on Deliveroo, Rachel Reeves’s recent request that “each of us must do our bit” makes me shudder. Because so many British taxpayers have no bit left to give, her own “bit”, in fact, has been to come within a 1p coin’s width of raising income tax off the backs of working people, a bad idea only worsened by her U-turn, which gives the distinct impression she’s not got a clue what she’s doing. To help out, I thought I’d offer...",https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/tax-budget-rachel-reeves-cost-of-living-crisis-millennials-b2871124.html,2025-11-24
Mark Wood urges England to ‘fight fire with fire’ and hit back after Perth loss | The Independent,"The tourists were beaten by eight wickets in the Ashes opener I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Mark Wood has called for England to “fight fire with fire” and avoid being hit with a knockout blow in the Ashes. The tourists are at a loose end in Perth, in the midst of three unscheduled days off after losing the series opener in double quick time. Wood is the first player to put his head above the parapet since Travis Head’s brutal century wrapped things up on the second evening, appearing on former team-mate Stuart Broad’s For the Love of Cricket podcast. The fast bowler offered some insights into how the team had taken their shattering defeat, revealing the mood was “flat”, but remains confident that they have the time and talent to turn things around. “We’ve been hit pretty hard in round one but we’ve got other rounds to try and throw some back,” he told Broad. “Ultimately we have to stick together because it’s...",https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/mark-wood-england-perth-australia-english-b2871033.html,2025-11-24
Chancellor urged to take ‘hard choices’ rather than hit businesses with more tax | The Independent,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Rachel Reeves has been warned not to inflict “death by a thousand taxes” on British business in Wednesday’s Budget. The head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Rain Newton-Smith said the Government must “change course” and avoid heaping more costs on firms. The Chancellor will hike taxes to fill a black hole in the public finances as she faces the prospect of a downgrade in the Budget watchdog’s economic growth forecast for every year of this Parliament. At the CBI’s conference in Westminster, Ms Newton-Smith urged Ms Reeves to stand up to Labour’s backbenchers to take tough decisions on issues such as cutting welfare spending. She said Ms Reeves had to prove she was committed to economic growth and make the hard choices to deliver it. “Prove it – against opposition, against short-term politics, be it on welfare, be it pension increases, show the markets you mean...",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/rachel-reeves-chancellor-government-people-office-for-budget-responsibility-b2871158.html,2025-11-24
The surprising reason why turkeys have become the main dish of Thanksgiving | The Independent,"Historians have long debated whether pilgrims ate turkey in 1621 I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Have you ever wondered why Thanksgiving revolves around turkey and not ham, chicken, venison, beef or corn? Almost 9 in 10 Americans eat turkey during this festive meal, whether it’s roasted, deep-fried, grilled or cooked in any other way for the occasion. You might believe it’s because of what the Pilgrims, a year after they landed in what’s now the state of Massachusetts, and their Indigenous Wampanoag guests ate during their first Thanksgiving feast in 1621. Or that it’s because turkey is originally from the Americas. But it has more to do with how Americans observed the holiday in the late 1800s than which poultry the Pilgrims ate while celebrating their bounty in 1621. The only firsthand record of what the Pilgrims ate at the first Thanksgiving feast comes from Edward Winslow. He noted that the Wampanoag leader,...",https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/thanksgiving-pilgrims-turkey-dinner-b2871382.html,2025-11-24
Four in 10 Republicans say Trump is sugarcoating on prices as Americans reveal the one cost that is killing them | The Independent,"Two new polls show that most in US say Trump makes concern over prices and the cost of living sound rosier than it is and they list housing, health care, groceries and utilities as top concerns I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Two new polls released over the weekend show that Americans still feel significant pain about the cost of living heading into the holiday season and that President Donald Trump is not doing enough to address it. A CBS News/YouGov poll showed that 60 percent of Americans believe that Trump makes prices and inflation sound better than they really are. By contrast, 27 percent say that Trump makes inflation and the costs of everyday goods sound about what they are, and 13 percent say he makes the news around inflation and prices sound worse than they actually are. But four in 10 Republicans in the survey say that the president is making affordability sound better than it actually is.

Thousands mourn Hezbollah commander killed in Israeli airstrike | The Independent,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Thousands of people on Monday attended the funeral organized by the militant Hezbollah group for its top military commander, a day after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a southern suburb of Beirut. Hezbollah supporters walked by Haytham Tabtabai’s coffin, draped in the group’s yellow flag, as it was carried through the crowd. The burial of Tabtabai and two other Hezbollah members took place in a cemetery south of Beirut where the group’s fighters are traditionally laid to rest. Israel on Sunday struck Lebanon’s capital for the first time since June, saying it killed Tabtabai. The Israeli military described him as Hezbollah’s chief of staff.

Read our Privacy notice A teen accused of experimenting with homemade bombs was “a big fan of Hitler”, a jury has heard. Rex Clark, 19, is on trial at Kingston Crown Court, accused of attempting to buy a handgun and disseminating terrorist materials online. The material allegedly included videos that glorified right-wing terrorists Anders Breivik, Brenton Tarrant, and Stephan Balliet. Clark was aged between 17 and 18 at the time of the alleged offences. He was an “avid internet user” who shared his “extreme right-wing interests” with his girlfriend Sofija Vinogradova, prosecutor Louis Mably KC told jurors on Monday. “The two of them would discuss their ideology, their ideas, and in this way seemed to spur each other on,” Mr Mably, opening the trial, said. “He experimented with making parts of explosive devices – in other words,...",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/neo-nazi-trial-rex-clark-b2871422.html,2025-11-24

Tory row erupts over jibe comparing Reform logo to Nazi badge | The Independent,"Conservative leader intervenes after party chair’s controversial tweet about Nigel Farage’s party I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Kemi Badenoch has defended Tory chair Kevin Hollinrake after a civil war erupted within her own party over his jibe comparing the logo of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK to a Nazi badge. The furious row was sparked after Mr Hollinrake posted a link to a Wikipedia entry about a badge handed out to members of Adolf Hitler’s party in response to a social media post from Nigel Farage showing a Reform emblem. Former Tory home secretary Suella Braverman hit out, saying, “comparing Reform and their supporters to Nazis is wrong, irresponsible and highly counter-productive” and added: “Kevin does not speak for me.” Ms Badenoch risked throwing fuel on the fire by highlighting the case last week of Nathan Gill, Reform’s former leader in Wales, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail for accepting...",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/reform-logo-nazi-badge-tories-hollinrake-badenoch-b2871276.html,2025-11-24
How to properly prep a turkey to deep fry and avoid an explosion on Thanksgiving | The Independent,"Raw meat can be anywhere from 56% to 73% water I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Deep-frying a turkey is a great way to get a delicious, moist meal for Thanksgiving. But this method of cooking can be a very dangerous undertaking. Every fall, millions of dollars of damage, trips to the ER and even deaths result from attempts to deep-fry turkeys. The vast majority of these accidents happen because people put frozen turkeys into boiling oil. If you are considering deep-frying this year, do not forget to thaw and dry your turkey before placing it in the pot. Failure to do so may lead to an explosive disaster. What is so dangerous about putting even a partially frozen turkey in a deep-fryer? I’m a chemist who studies plant, fungal and animal compounds and have a love of food chemistry. The reason frozen turkeys explode, at its core, has to do with differences in density. There is a difference in density between oil and...",https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/turkey-thanksgiving-deep-fry-fire-explosion-oil-b2871366.html,2025-11-24
Winter Olympics chiefs reveal back-up plan for torch lighting ceremony amid weather fears | The Independent,"The official torch lighting ceremony for February’s Winter Olympics is due to take place on Wednesday I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Ancient Olympia hosted an emergency rehearsal on Monday to light the flame for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games, capitalising on a brief respite in Greece’s stormy weather. With heavy cloud cover predicted for Wednesday’s official lighting ceremony, the flame ignited during the rehearsal will be preserved as a backup. An actress, embodying an ancient high priestess, employed a concave mirror to focus the sun’s rays onto a torch. The ignition took just seven seconds, maintaining a 2,800-year-old tradition, free from artificial aids. The ritual, which included a theatrical invocation of Apollo, the ancient god of light, underscores the reliance on natural elements. However, the success of this ancient method hinges on simple, unforgiving physics: direct sunlight must be focused...",https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/winter-olympics/winter-olympics-torch-lighting-backup-plan-weather-fears-b2871408.html,2025-11-24
